"As much as I would like to recommend this game, because I think it has potential to be great, but the state it is in right now makes it hard to love it. I only have two hours or so which may make you think I'm just some stupid angry kid, but the reason I only have two hours is because the patch that was suppose to fix bugs was a bug itself. It wouldn't download. I was able to download updates for all other games, but when cyberpunk came to the top my network and disk would plummet to the bottom. I've tried a few fixes and the one I'm in the process of trying is deleting and re downloading it. In my opinion this game needed another month or so in the oven, because I would've been fine waiting another month or so for a great game rather than the glitch and bug filled experience I have been having. I hope that one day I can recommend this game, but in the state it is in I can't.",as much as i would like to recommend this game because i think it has potential to be great but the state it is in right now makes it hard to love it i only have two hours or so which may make you think im just some stupid angry kid but the reason i only have two hours is because the patch that was suppose to fix bugs was a bug itself it wouldnt download i was able to download updates for all other games but when cyberpunk came to the top my network and disk would plummet to the bottom ive tried a few fixes and the one im in the process of trying is deleting and re downloading it in my opinion this game needed another month or so in the oven because i wouldve been fine waiting another month or so for a great game rather than the glitch and bug filled experience i have been having i hope that one day i can recommend this game but in the state it is in i cant,much would like recommend game think potential great state right make hard love two hour may make think im stupid angry kid reason two hour patch suppose fix bug bug wouldnt download able download update game cyberpunk came top network disk would plummet bottom ive tried fix one im process trying deleting downloading opinion game needed another month oven wouldve fine waiting another month great game rather glitch bug filled experience hope one day recommend game state cant,Negative

"Buggy mess, quests bugged out on me and stopped me from progressing thru the story for ALMOST A YEAR!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I had to spam report customer service for months on end just for them to tell me that they dont know what was wrong (at the moment) and that there wasnt anything they could do so I didnt touch the game for a couple of months. August 2021 I launched the game up randomly and the issue was fixed but by this time I forgot a lot of what happened and couldnt care less about the ending(s) . A lot of what they promised STILL isnt in the game such as multiplayer. And A LOT of the original developers left in protest of how the game was managed, so even tho they are taking the time and effort to fix the game and add expansions, dont expect much.

This game has its issues but over all the hate is overdone. Yes It's buggy at times and it could have used a few more months of development but all in all I've enjoyed this game. The AI is a little dumb but the combat is fun. The level progression is fast paced to the point where it can be challenging while also making you feel like an OP cyber-god.

I love the story and various side quests.   I love the character designs.   the combat is ok, but not the best.   Driving can be fun, especially with a bike.   Night city is incredible, with some many varying paths, details and cool neighbourhoods.  Life paths don't seem to have impact but V explores every group within the city, so you really do get a taste of the underbelly of the city, the outlying nomad culture and corporate culture.

"""Cyberpunk is a diamond in the rough, but its still not done.""Cyberpunk is horribly optimized and has an overworld that doesn't really fit into the story very well. Night City feels like a backdrop whose glow then collapses when you look behind the scenes. The NPCs are incredibly stupid and poorly animated.High-tech cops from the future can't handle pursuing a mass murderer into a sushi bar. Admittedly, in comparable games like GTA you could also trick the police in such ways, but in this game the concept of the friend and helper seems a little unreworked. There is almost no water physics and driving the vehicles isn't as bad in any other game.The many bugs still exist in places that are so important to the story that CDP should have fixed them. The cyber effects and flickering of many scenes could have been removed less for one or the other epileptic seizure.At one point the story seems incredibly rushed that you can literally feel the developers running out of timeStill, I had fun with the game. And how I had him. In hardly any game have the characters grown so dear to me as in CP. You go through fat and thin with them, go through every mess with them and want to make everyone happy in the end, which - SPOILER - doesn't work. The approach to the story and the idea behind the story are also fantastically creative, although it hardly ever reaches its climax. The gameplay is crisp, the different skills are at least so varied that I didn't get bored with the second character either. In addition, the soundtrack is fantastic and accompanies the nerve-wracking moments of this game. The world feels alive in an odd way, despite the poor polish. There are logs to read, collectibles to discover and criminals to beat up everywhere.Conclusion: Cyberpunk isn't nearly the masterpiece that many editors have called it and not nearly as bad as it was when it was released on the Play Station. It's a good game that anyone with an interest and a suitable PC can access without worrying.8/10",cyberpunk is a diamond in the rough but its still not donecyberpunk is horribly optimized and has an overworld that doesnt really fit into the story very well night city feels like a backdrop whose glow then collapses when you look behind the scenes the npcs are incredibly stupid and poorly animatedhightech cops from the future cant handle pursuing a mass murderer into a sushi bar admittedly in comparable games like gta you could also trick the police in such ways but in this game the concept of the friend and helper seems a little unreworked there is almost no water physics and driving the vehicles isnt as bad in any other gamethe many bugs still exist in places that are so important to the story that cdp should have fixed them the cyber effects and flickering of many scenes could have been removed less for one or the other epileptic seizureat one point the story seems incredibly rushed that you can literally feel the developers running out of timestill i had fun with the game and how i had him in hardly any game have the characters grown so dear to me as in cp you go through fat and thin with them go through every mess with them and want to make everyone happy in the end which  spoiler  doesnt work the approach to the story and the idea behind the story are also fantastically creative although it hardly ever reaches its climax the gameplay is crisp the different skills are at least so varied that i didnt get bored with the second character either in addition the soundtrack is fantastic and accompanies the nervewracking moments of this game the world feels alive in an odd way despite the poor polish there are logs to read collectibles to discover and criminals to beat up everywhereconclusion cyberpunk isnt nearly the masterpiece that many editors have called it and not nearly as bad as it was when it was released on the play station its a good game that anyone with an interest and a suitable pc can access without worrying,cyberpunk diamond rough still donecyberpunk horribly optimized overworld doesnt really fit story well night city feel like backdrop whose glow collapse look behind scene npc incredibly stupid poorly animatedhightech cop future cant handle pursuing mass murderer sushi bar admittedly comparable game like gta could also trick police way game concept friend helper seems little unreworked almost water physic driving vehicle isnt bad gamethe many bug still exist place important story cdp fixed cyber effect flickering many scene could removed le one epileptic seizureat one point story seems incredibly rushed literally feel developer running timestill fun game hardly game character grown dear cp go fat thin go every mess want make everyone happy end spoiler doesnt work approach story idea behind story also fantastically creative although hardly ever reach climax gameplay crisp different skill least varied didnt get bored second character either addition soundtrack fantastic accompanies nervewracking moment game world feel alive odd way despite poor polish log read collectible discover criminal beat everywhereconclusion cyberpunk isnt nearly masterpiece many editor called nearly bad released play station good game anyone interest suitable pc access without worrying,Positive

"First of all game is in great condition. Almost all the bugs fixed and graphic optimization is better than I thought. Its story is taking me away. Its really good and fun to play.

If you look around and just want to explore the Cyberpunk 2077's world, there tones of things to explore. Missions are not repeating itself, until you get it like just shooting.

"This game is not buggy, it's straight up unfinished. There are bugs littered all over the place, completely ruining the experience by breaking immersion or just by amazing you in ways you've never thought of before. In fact, I wouldn't even classify all this as bugs. To me it seems that these are straight up the results of an unfinished, far from refined product. It's absolutely horrible that CD Projekt Red piggy-backed from their reputation of making the Witcher series, combined with giving life to an actual open-world Cyberpunk action RPG and released this mess of a game. There are a large amount of animations that are far from good, due to the fact that they simply remain unfinished. C'mon man, how the hell am I supposed to stay focused when my attention is on a guy eating a hamburger's ?????? animation loop where the hamburger isn't even properly textured or on the same level of his mouth, or when the keys take a long time to actually register or when I'm permanently stuck in scanner mode? I've seen literal cars glitch out mid-animation and then teleport, same with people. They constantly slide all over the ground like they're Jesus walking on water but they don't even walk, they teleport and repeat. The optimization is god awful, for no good reason either. The textures and overall graphics aren't even good, and console users are reporting the same thing. A big patch isn't gonna fix even half the problems this game has, it is gonna need a No Man's Sky tier of series of patches to even get this game to be close to finish from the looks of it. Please people, let this game be a lesson to you- no matter how trustworthy a publisher or developer have been in the past, no matter how many good games they released, do not pre-order their games and do not fill it with unbelievable amounts of hype. Wait until the game comes out to see the feedback from actual gamers, not journalists who give the game a high rating in order for their magazine to continue getting big paychecks and early access to games. The video game industry is going downhill because of developers and publishers like this, they shove out these unfinished products because they know we'll eat it all up and to be honest, HOW were we supposed to know? They completely manipulated us, and as Kazuhira Miller once said, ""played us like a damn fiddle.""",this game is not buggy its straight up unfinished there are bugs littered all over the place completely ruining the experience by breaking immersion or just by amazing you in ways youve never thought of before in fact i wouldnt even classify all this as bugs to me it seems that these are straight up the results of an unfinished far from refined product its absolutely horrible that cd projekt red piggybacked from their reputation of making the witcher series combined with giving life to an actual openworld cyberpunk action rpg and released this mess of a game there are a large amount of animations that are far from good due to the fact that they simply remain unfinished cmon man how the hell am i supposed to stay focused when my attention is on a guy eating a hamburgers  animation loop where the hamburger isnt even properly textured or on the same level of his mouth or when the keys take a long time to actually register or when im permanently stuck in scanner mode ive seen literal cars glitch out midanimation and then teleport same with people they constantly slide all over the ground like theyre jesus walking on water but they dont even walk they teleport and repeat the optimization is god awful for no good reason either the textures and overall graphics arent even good and console users are reporting the same thing a big patch isnt gonna fix even half the problems this game has it is gonna need a no mans sky tier of series of patches to even get this game to be close to finish from the looks of it please people let this game be a lesson to you no matter how trustworthy a publisher or developer have been in the past no matter how many good games they released do not preorder their games and do not fill it with unbelievable amounts of hype wait until the game comes out to see the feedback from actual gamers not journalists who give the game a high rating in order for their magazine to continue getting big paychecks and early access to games the video game industry is going downhill because of developers and publishers like this they shove out these unfinished products because they know well eat it all up and to be honest how were we supposed to know they completely manipulated us and as kazuhira miller once said played us like a damn fiddle,game buggy straight unfinished bug littered place completely ruining experience breaking immersion amazing way youve never thought fact wouldnt even classify bug seems straight result unfinished far refined product absolutely horrible cd projekt red piggybacked reputation making witcher series combined giving life actual openworld cyberpunk action rpg released mess game large amount animation far good due fact simply remain unfinished cmon man hell supposed stay focused attention guy eating hamburger animation loop hamburger isnt even properly textured level mouth key take long time actually register im permanently stuck scanner mode ive seen literal car glitch midanimation teleport people constantly slide ground like theyre jesus walking water dont even walk teleport repeat optimization god awful good reason either texture overall graphic arent even good console user reporting thing big patch isnt gon na fix even half problem game gon na need man sky tier series patch even get game close finish look please people let game lesson matter trustworthy publisher developer past matter many good game released preorder game fill unbelievable amount hype wait game come see feedback actual gamers journalist give game high rating order magazine continue getting big paycheck early access game video game industry going downhill developer publisher like shove unfinished product know well eat honest supposed know completely manipulated u kazuhira miller said played u like damn fiddle,Negative

I got this game for PS4 on release day instead of PC as I figured the console would be better optimized (ha!) than it would probably be on my then PC. I had all the issues with it but knuckled up and dropped around 50 hours into it. I stopped after I heard a slate of patches were coming and figured I would be as well waiting since I was getting a new PC. So I got my beast of a machine and dropped the cash on the PC copy and transferred my saves. Only to have inconsistent crashing. CDPR insists that I disable any software that uses overlays (or any software at all really) my sound drivers and invoke an arcane ritual to boot it up. Sometimes I get to play 4 or 5 hours with no hitch. Then I reboot and it crashes when I pause or access inventory or change the time. It's the inconsistency that is frustrating and the fact this has been an issue for months. Sometimes I delete the cache and get a good session in. Other times can't even get past the logo. I have tried uninstalling and reinstalling drivers and files and briefly considered installing an older version of windows before realizing I should not be jumping through this many hoops to play a game. I WANT to love this game but it is so hard to play it's frustrating. I am leaving this negative review to add my pebble to the hopeful landslide of pressure to make fixing this issue a priority.,i got this game for ps on release day instead of pc as i figured the console would be better optimized ha than it would probably be on my then pc i had all the issues with it but knuckled up and dropped around  hours into it i stopped after i heard a slate of patches were coming and figured i would be as well waiting since i was getting a new pc so i got my beast of a machine and dropped the cash on the pc copy and transferred my saves only to have inconsistent crashing cdpr insists that i disable any software that uses overlays or any software at all really my sound drivers and invoke an arcane ritual to boot it up sometimes i get to play  or  hours with no hitch then i reboot and it crashes when i pause or access inventory or change the time its the inconsistency that is frustrating and the fact this has been an issue for months sometimes i delete the cache and get a good session in other times cant even get past the logo i have tried uninstalling and reinstalling drivers and files and briefly considered installing an older version of windows before realizing i should not be jumping through this many hoops to play a game i want to love this game but it is so hard to play its frustrating i am leaving this negative review to add my pebble to the hopeful landslide of pressure to make fixing this issue a priority,got game p release day instead pc figured console would better optimized ha would probably pc issue knuckled dropped around hour stopped heard slate patch coming figured would well waiting since getting new pc got beast machine dropped cash pc copy transferred save inconsistent crashing cdpr insists disable software us overlay software really sound driver invoke arcane ritual boot sometimes get play hour hitch reboot crash pause access inventory change time inconsistency frustrating fact issue month sometimes delete cache get good session time cant even get past logo tried uninstalling reinstalling driver file briefly considered installing older version window realizing jumping many hoop play game want love game hard play frustrating leaving negative review add pebble hopeful landslide pressure make fixing issue priority,Negative

"It's been 8 Months and they've barely done anything other than making it run slightly better (still terrible) on old last gen console hardware.On PC the draw distance and level of detail both have been massively degraded with ""optimization"" updates resulting in ridiculous pop-in of textures and geometry, even on ultra settings. Now the game that started out as the best looking PC game out ever, ended up looking incredibly bad and cheap because stuff just pops into existance 10 meters in front of you.

"Cyberpunk 2077 is an intelligent and monumental immersion of the cyberpunk universe breathing a soul into the original ttrpgs to newer generation entertainment mediums. It is game which can't be explained but a player has to be in affair with the game to reside and feel the true life Night City offers. A player has a choice to be whatever the fk he/she wants, has a say in everything from origins, to relations and friendship, freedom of finger tip access to body enhancement technology also commonly known as cyberware even with the abilities to install a second heart to resurrect if you flatline or secure a copy of your soul/digitized psyche on a biochip for the road of immortality, player can play as a netrunner hacking every dead to living thing in NC to stealth as an option if player enjoys mercenary turned hitman experience, you can go rain the streets of NC with blood and bullets as a john wick or if you want to you can slice and smash everything in your way with cyberware alike gorilla arms or mantis blades. In short CDPR offers unbelievable combat freedoms to a player to such lengths as you may finish the game even without terminating a single life. Apart from the buggy controversy and backlash the game received, it still holds the potential to grow into what CDPR promised. Despite the bugs and conflicting performance issues it still holds to be a beautiful and astounding piece of media.If explaining in short the game, the game can be praised for :- Eye pleasing Graphics- Story of you (V) and J.S web entangled at the core- Beautiful cast of dialog building characters - Body Enchancement Technology - A perfect score - Freedom of choice towards the approach of gameplay. As a player may fully customise   himself with each and every piece of story, lore, gig and iron night city offers or can even go   haboobs and finish the game with a level 10 build.- Non stop seamless and harmonious gameplay after booting once into NC.The only thing holding a perfect rating is - Night City might be in 2077 but it is in its alpha phase. Players may wait till summer as the   devs deliver number of hotfixes polishing the Night City.- Promised/Expected but missing features for example wallrunning, dynamic and challenging   weather system, metro stations and ofcourse strip clubs xD- Too much repetitive NCPD gigs which offers nothing more than loot and eddies- Alot of things from pre-release advertisements the game failed to fulfil like daily routine   activities and hobbies, impacting back story, complex branching story paths.- Something to do with various factions and ability to interact/quests with them.- Ultimately lacking complex choice options and different consequential outcomes.- You are V and the game is Keanu Reeves.- The game is full of illusion of choice after first playthrough and is an incomplete project.My rating deserves to be 5.5/10 for the moment and may change for future versions of NC. At the current state of the game it is not recommended to play especially if you are expecting to go GTA MODE in NC. Unless you are interested in story driven aspects of rpg games this is where the game shines atleast at the moment.

"I cannot recommend buying in its current state, the game feels considerably unpolished. I've only played around four hours or so and already encountered bugs in nearly every aspect of the game. From characters walking through walls, falling through floors, to items / loot on the floor not being accessable.

This is a Good Game imo.  I did not pay any attn to the game running up to release so i had no expectations.  20 hrs in seems to scratch the surface.  The story so far is gripping me and is well written pulling me deeper into the game.  Games that combine combat with remote hacking of cams comps and even peoples implants keeps fighting fresh for me.   So if you want todo moar than just point and shoot this game has EWAR to Boot.

"When I played Witcher 1 back when it came out, I enjoyed it and thought it had earned an 80/100.  I was happy to experience Witcher 2 (both paths) and felt it was a very solid 90/100.  Witcher 3 blew me away and was an easy 100/100 and with the amazing DLC even more if that was possible on that scale.  Thronebreaker was a very solid 90/100 for what it was.This is my first Steam review and holy hell am I disappointed.  My game is playable in the absolute loosest sense of the term.  I am about 9 hours in and that is only because of the tremendous faith that the Witcher series gave me in CDPR.  I had to believe that something would improve.According to howlongtobeat, the game is about 30 hours.  This means that I am a third through the demo, I mean game.  There are ton of upgrades I don't care about that I might need? Want?  I have no idea.  I am level 8.  I guess I have 8 upgrades.  Can I tell? No.  Do I know what they are?  Something about 10% faster reloads?  It doesn't matter because I can run next to the AI during combat and shoot them in the head while they look into a pillar.  The open world is a joke to me.  No NPC has said anything interesting to me whatsoever.  The most common response I get is something akin to ""I don't know you pal....""  Ok then Mr. Streetfood Vendor.  Sorry for bothering you.This game needed at least another year in dev, maybe two.   The paths? Do they matter? I have no idea, it seemed like my nomad was over in 10 minutes.  Never saw the sheriff or w/e again.   I guess he didn't mind me climbing the tower he told me not to?  Couldn't pick up the card or w/e was in the tower.  Was I supposed to?  No idea.  Also, I fell from said tower as I went to the ladder as I'm guessing almost everyone else did.Well anyway, something about a big turd comes to mind.  I was just on a mission and apparently I asked Johnny if something seemed out of order.  I had no idea I was communicating with the guy as the last time I saw him he said to kill myself.  Maybe we are frenemies now?  I have no idea as it was out of the blue.   I am guessing that I did a side mission before I was supposed to do something else.Speaking of side missions.  What the fk are they?  Do I do them?  Why would I do them?  My phone keeps blowing up without prompting or any kind of heads-up.  Do I know the people calling and texting me?  I have no idea, but they seem to want me to do stuff for them.  Do I get stuff?  Maybe?  Thank god I watched all of the gameplay videos the past summer so as I replay them now I have some idea as to what the hell is happening, albeit with worse resolution.  Combat?  Next.So anyway, there appears to be a huge map, but as I am already 1/3 through the game somehow and most of that was 3 missions, I have no idea what the rest of the map is for.  I also should be upgrading and crafting a ton?  Right?  Well I don't know how to craft, or why I even would at this point.  Remember about the AI facing the pillars?  I barely have heard any of the music, but that ??? Black and Blue song has to go. It's the only one I remember.  Maybe because it's the only one without a reggaeton beat.  I hate reggaeton beats.  Wait, does it also have a reggaeton beat?  Either way, that Black and Blue song sucks hard.The music I do like seems to come from the same guys that worked on Witcher 3.  Remember the Crones' music? I heard glimpses of that and I got happy.  Did they work on this game too? Good for them.  The rest make me want to tween barf.Anyway, good to all those that worked hard on this game.  There is a lot of detail and it shows. But holy hell I forget what to say and/or care about as I muddle my way from something that I wanted desperately to be great and I am struggling through to even know how bad this release is.    Fuchsia does not a game make.Do I need to play more?  The combat is terrible so that won't keep me around.  There isn't a challenge so that won't keep me around.  The narrative is jumpy, glitchy, inconstant, random, and even worse, shallow it seems.  I had a bad feeling when they went first-person, but that's easy for me to say now right?  Anyway, they bit off WAY more than they can chew and this may go down, although hopefully not, as one of the all-time letdowns in AAA games.  Honestly, this game is too janky for me to even make a decent analysis of.  If I wasn't aware of the 30ish hour play time I would be much easier, but knowing that I am a third through it and can't figure ???? from ?????

"Posted a discussion about this and will post my opinion here as well.This game is boring at the current state. It honestly seems like CDPR wasted all their funding on marketing to build up hype and forgot to finish their game. The ambient is great, the music is awesome and i love many aspects of the game, but even after all this it is just too shallow, the story missions being the only thing saving it atm.For such a lively city it really stands out for lacking events, interactions, more of ""natural life"" and less of ""artificial script"".The game is also so overly sexualized it looks like they had a twelve-yo who had just discovered porn on their team, i mean, you cant walk a block without seeing sex-based ads, sex-based neons or sex-focused people. Dont get me wrong, i dont mind the sex but this just looks like they've focused on the sexual part of the cyberpunk genre and left the rest as an afterthought.And even then, being so deep in sex and ""LOOK AT THIS GAME YOU CAN CREATE A WOMAN WITH PEEN PEEN AND BIGG TIT HAHA AINT THAT SWELL"", they couldnt even bother to add interactive strip clubs and more than two prostitutes.And dont even get me started on performance and bugs. I really looks like they just tried to get everyone stick-bugged by posting completely inaccurate hardware pre-requisites.That being said, i really liked the driving, the vehicles are nice and feel cyberpunk-ish, the music is great and really accompanies the great main story, and i liked the combat even if the enemy and general AI might as well be called A since there's no trace of intelligence.The game is not bad, i just think it focused too much on building hype and paying Keanu Reeves and less on actually making the game feel deep.Will update the review once things start patching and getting better and CDPR shows interest in bettering their game, but at the moment it just isnt worth the hype, imo.",posted a discussion about this and will post my opinion here as wellthis game is boring at the current state it honestly seems like cdpr wasted all their funding on marketing to build up hype and forgot to finish their game the ambient is great the music is awesome and i love many aspects of the game but even after all this it is just too shallow the story missions being the only thing saving it atmfor such a lively city it really stands out for lacking events interactions more of natural life and less of artificial scriptthe game is also so overly sexualized it looks like they had a twelveyo who had just discovered porn on their team i mean you cant walk a block without seeing sexbased ads sexbased neons or sexfocused people dont get me wrong i dont mind the sex but this just looks like theyve focused on the sexual part of the cyberpunk genre and left the rest as an afterthoughtand even then being so deep in sex and look at this game you can create a woman with peen peen and bigg tit haha aint that swell they couldnt even bother to add interactive strip clubs and more than two prostitutesand dont even get me started on performance and bugs i really looks like they just tried to get everyone stickbugged by posting completely inaccurate hardware prerequisitesthat being said i really liked the driving the vehicles are nice and feel cyberpunkish the music is great and really accompanies the great main story and i liked the combat even if the enemy and general ai might as well be called a since theres no trace of intelligencethe game is not bad i just think it focused too much on building hype and paying keanu reeves and less on actually making the game feel deepwill update the review once things start patching and getting better and cdpr shows interest in bettering their game but at the moment it just isnt worth the hype imo,posted discussion post opinion wellthis game boring current state honestly seems like cdpr wasted funding marketing build hype forgot finish game ambient great music awesome love many aspect game even shallow story mission thing saving atmfor lively city really stand lacking event interaction natural life le artificial scriptthe game also overly sexualized look like twelveyo discovered porn team mean cant walk block without seeing sexbased ad sexbased neon sexfocused people dont get wrong dont mind sex look like theyve focused sexual part cyberpunk genre left rest afterthoughtand even deep sex look game create woman peen peen bigg tit haha aint swell couldnt even bother add interactive strip club two prostitutesand dont even get started performance bug really look like tried get everyone stickbugged posting completely inaccurate hardware prerequisitesthat said really liked driving vehicle nice feel cyberpunkish music great really accompanies great main story liked combat even enemy general ai might well called since there trace intelligencethe game bad think focused much building hype paying keanu reef le actually making game feel deepwill update review thing start patching getting better cdpr show interest bettering game moment isnt worth hype imo,Negative

"This is a tough one. I'm writing this review for players like me, who play RPGs for the immersion in a world with rich gameplay and interesting, diverse roleplaying options. I intend to write this review for the game design itself, not taking into account any bugs or glitches.First off, let's tackle immersion. Obviously the environment was masterfully done, and that goes a long way. However, here are some negative points. There are a lot of random NPCs, which is great, but they all have basically the same behavior. There are many street stalls, restaurants, and shops, but it disappointed me that I could only actually interact with a fraction of them. V never needs to eat, drink, or sleep. V has an apartment but you never really need to go there. The side events feel scripted and there are too many of them. It ends up being shallow compared to other games which are out there, such as Red Dead.I found the gameplay to be OK. In the early game, enemies are damage sponges, which was frustrating. The breach protocol puzzle is repetitive. The higher level quickhacks are usually just increased damage versions of lower level ones. The perks typically just add some damage bonus, or, in the case of hacking, make you faster at it. It wasn't very interesting. Compared to, say, the different shouts one can learn in Skyrim, character progression wasn't impressive.Cyberpunk 2077 has no mini-games. That is inexcusable in any computer RPG, much less a cyberpunk-themed one. Even Stardew Valley has arcade mini-games. Cyberpunk 2077 has in-world arcade machines that you can't play. The car racing in Cyberpunk is an illusion of a mini-game; it's scripted so that you win.Roleplaying is basically non-existent IMO. The life paths (nomad, streetkid, or corpo) are inconsequential, and the dialogue options always seem to converge into one branch. To be fair, obviously it's a computer RPG, so you can't expect too much. However the roleplaying pales in comparison to other computer RPGs out there. For example the roleplaying in Disco Elysium blows this away. Maybe that's not a fair comparison, since DE specializes in roleplaying while Cyberpunk 2077 is a more jack-of-all-trades type of game. A fairer comparison would be to Mass Effect or RDR2, both of which have honor systems, and RDR2 has a sophisticated bounty system on top of that. Cyberpunk 2077 has neither of those things. If you commit a crime, the cops look for you for a while and either kill you or give up looking. Then it's like nothing ever happened.User interface tools are bad. The equipment/inventory screen in particular is bad, although not quite New Vegas Pip-Boy bad. Conclusion: Good story and a beautiful world. Not a very interesting game. I ended up rushing through the main story after a while so I could play a better RPG.",this is a tough one im writing this review for players like me who play rpgs for the immersion in a world with rich gameplay and interesting diverse roleplaying options i intend to write this review for the game design itself not taking into account any bugs or glitchesfirst off lets tackle immersion obviously the environment was masterfully done and that goes a long way however here are some negative points there are a lot of random npcs which is great but they all have basically the same behavior there are many street stalls restaurants and shops but it disappointed me that i could only actually interact with a fraction of them v never needs to eat drink or sleep v has an apartment but you never really need to go there the side events feel scripted and there are too many of them it ends up being shallow compared to other games which are out there such as red deadi found the gameplay to be ok in the early game enemies are damage sponges which was frustrating the breach protocol puzzle is repetitive the higher level quickhacks are usually just increased damage versions of lower level ones the perks typically just add some damage bonus or in the case of hacking make you faster at it it wasnt very interesting compared to say the different shouts one can learn in skyrim character progression wasnt impressivecyberpunk  has no minigames that is inexcusable in any computer rpg much less a cyberpunkthemed one even stardew valley has arcade minigames cyberpunk  has inworld arcade machines that you cant play the car racing in cyberpunk is an illusion of a minigame its scripted so that you winroleplaying is basically nonexistent imo the life paths nomad streetkid or corpo are inconsequential and the dialogue options always seem to converge into one branch to be fair obviously its a computer rpg so you cant expect too much however the roleplaying pales in comparison to other computer rpgs out there for example the roleplaying in disco elysium blows this away maybe thats not a fair comparison since de specializes in roleplaying while cyberpunk  is a more jackofalltrades type of game a fairer comparison would be to mass effect or rdr both of which have honor systems and rdr has a sophisticated bounty system on top of that cyberpunk  has neither of those things if you commit a crime the cops look for you for a while and either kill you or give up looking then its like nothing ever happeneduser interface tools are bad the equipmentinventory screen in particular is bad although not quite new vegas pipboy bad conclusion good story and a beautiful world not a very interesting game i ended up rushing through the main story after a while so i could play a better rpg,tough one im writing review player like play rpgs immersion world rich gameplay interesting diverse roleplaying option intend write review game design taking account bug glitchesfirst let tackle immersion obviously environment masterfully done go long way however negative point lot random npc great basically behavior many street stall restaurant shop disappointed could actually interact fraction v never need eat drink sleep v apartment never really need go side event feel scripted many end shallow compared game red deadi found gameplay ok early game enemy damage sponge frustrating breach protocol puzzle repetitive higher level quickhacks usually increased damage version lower level one perk typically add damage bonus case hacking make faster wasnt interesting compared say different shout one learn skyrim character progression wasnt impressivecyberpunk minigames inexcusable computer rpg much le cyberpunkthemed one even stardew valley arcade minigames cyberpunk inworld arcade machine cant play car racing cyberpunk illusion minigame scripted winroleplaying basically nonexistent imo life path nomad streetkid corpo inconsequential dialogue option always seem converge one branch fair obviously computer rpg cant expect much however roleplaying pale comparison computer rpgs example roleplaying disco elysium blow away maybe thats fair comparison since de specializes roleplaying cyberpunk jackofalltrades type game fairer comparison would mass effect rdr honor system rdr sophisticated bounty system top cyberpunk neither thing commit crime cop look either kill give looking like nothing ever happeneduser interface tool bad equipmentinventory screen particular bad although quite new vega pipboy bad conclusion good story beautiful world interesting game ended rushing main story could play better rpg,Negative

"This game really is beautiful... That is when it works properly! After waiting for the game to install the update I tried launching it, managed to create a character and attempt to load into the prologue. Once I hit finished on the character creation my game crashed, I tried to relaunch it only to get the CD Project logo and crash again. Looked up some things such as turning off overlay from GoG (even tried disabling overlay on steam) and it kept on crashing at the logo. Then I checked if there was an update for my drivers and I did, I had to find this out on my own after failing to find any information on it online. So I installed the update and try launching the game, it works this time and I get past the character creation and I start thinking ""Oh finally, time to play the game I've been waiting for"" only for it to crash once again in the middle of dialogue. So I relaunch again, create new character because it didn't save, and I get past the opening cutscene and I haft to go talk to someone, I get pretty far, talk to said person, and go follow the marker on the screen. I exit the room and CRASH. Luckily this time it auto saved so I continued onward to the objective, I reach said objective and before continuing I save manually and guess what? It crashes my entire PC and forces me to restart and wait for stuff to load back up, I launch the game again and try loading the save only to find out the save was corrupted and I haft to load up the autosave where I left the room. I try saving again manually and once again PC crashes on me for no reason. I really hope they release a patch for this game because I'd really like to play it but currently I don't want to play something that I can lose tons of progress on just because saving manually kills my PC",this game really is beautiful that is when it works properly after waiting for the game to install the update i tried launching it managed to create a character and attempt to load into the prologue once i hit finished on the character creation my game crashed i tried to relaunch it only to get the cd project logo and crash again looked up some things such as turning off overlay from gog even tried disabling overlay on steam and it kept on crashing at the logo then i checked if there was an update for my drivers and i did i had to find this out on my own after failing to find any information on it online so i installed the update and try launching the game it works this time and i get past the character creation and i start thinking oh finally time to play the game ive been waiting for only for it to crash once again in the middle of dialogue so i relaunch again create new character because it didnt save and i get past the opening cutscene and i haft to go talk to someone i get pretty far talk to said person and go follow the marker on the screen i exit the room and crash luckily this time it auto saved so i continued onward to the objective i reach said objective and before continuing i save manually and guess what it crashes my entire pc and forces me to restart and wait for stuff to load back up i launch the game again and try loading the save only to find out the save was corrupted and i haft to load up the autosave where i left the room i try saving again manually and once again pc crashes on me for no reason i really hope they release a patch for this game because id really like to play it but currently i dont want to play something that i can lose tons of progress on just because saving manually kills my pc,game really beautiful work properly waiting game install update tried launching managed create character attempt load prologue hit finished character creation game crashed tried relaunch get cd project logo crash looked thing turning overlay gog even tried disabling overlay steam kept crashing logo checked update driver find failing find information online installed update try launching game work time get past character creation start thinking oh finally time play game ive waiting crash middle dialogue relaunch create new character didnt save get past opening cutscene haft go talk someone get pretty far talk said person go follow marker screen exit room crash luckily time auto saved continued onward objective reach said objective continuing save manually guess crash entire pc force restart wait stuff load back launch game try loading save find save corrupted haft load autosave left room try saving manually pc crash reason really hope release patch game id really like play currently dont want play something lose ton progress saving manually kill pc,Negative

"Boring as hell. Lives up to literally none of the expectations its developers set. While it does still have glaring bugs, it mostly functions fine. However, the player has virtually no meaningful influence over the main character. The secondary character, Johnny, is possibly the most annoying, conceited, incompetent, hypocritical prick I've ever seen, and the voice actor is so monotone and uninspired that the developers could have just replaced him with Google translate. The side quests are mostly uninteresting, the entire city has nothing fun to do, the crafting system is mind-numbingly tedious, and the main quest line is so utterly boring that I probably didn't even make it halfway before moving on with my life.",boring as hell lives up to literally none of the expectations its developers set while it does still have glaring bugs it mostly functions fine however the player has virtually no meaningful influence over the main character the secondary character johnny is possibly the most annoying conceited incompetent hypocritical prick ive ever seen and the voice actor is so monotone and uninspired that the developers could have just replaced him with google translate the side quests are mostly uninteresting the entire city has nothing fun to do the crafting system is mindnumbingly tedious and the main quest line is so utterly boring that i probably didnt even make it halfway before moving on with my life,boring hell life literally none expectation developer set still glaring bug mostly function fine however player virtually meaningful influence main character secondary character johnny possibly annoying conceited incompetent hypocritical prick ive ever seen voice actor monotone uninspired developer could replaced google translate side quest mostly uninteresting entire city nothing fun crafting system mindnumbingly tedious main quest line utterly boring probably didnt even make halfway moving life,Negative

I loved skyrim, however, I am tired of games releasing in alpha/beta without the developer having enough self awarness to maybe ask the community if they want to have it released as ""early access"" with a vote.

"Despite the games multiple bugs (most are fun and harmless aside from a few game-breaking bugs), Cyberpunk 2077 has impressed me. I'm not always the biggest fan of first-person games, and I really didn't know what to expect when this game arrived, but I found myself addicted to it, despite everything.There are things in the game that don't feel realistic, all the way from absent ragdoll physics to the way the cops spawn in behind you to the way npc's don't really react to stuff the way they do in like GTA. The game feels absent-minded at times, and feels like an unfinished universe with very dull-reacting population. The game feels like an early access game, but it feels like a really, really good early access game. Essentially, it feels like a game that has a very large amount of future potential once future fixes and updates arrive.The game overall has questionable combat at times, but nevertheless gets the job done. I'd say in a way it plays kinda like Borderlands but with a more toned down feel and with less variety overall. However, there is still more than enough content to sustain most people. The story of the game I actually think is well done, despite how fast-paced the opening arc is, whereas I would prefer to have had more time to get to know various characters before the story really begins. My main issue with the game is the dialogue choices. They're great, but nothing you say or do can impact your ending until a very specific mission towards the very end of the game. Only your choices in that mission matter for the ending none of the other missions impact it, unless you romance certain characters or finish specific side missions- which can also affect the outcome. All in all, despite what happens on the first playthrough, there is a very specific ending that I consider to be the best, and canon, ending. That ending in my opinion is what makes the game, and makes everything feel worth it in the end. When it comes to the leveling system and perks, I think they did a really good job and they really well with implementing some of those specific skills sets for various dialogue choices and specific actions you can do at different points in the game. The amount of side missions are insane. There are hundreds I feel like I this is where the game really shines to me. From different mini-story arcs that grow you closer to side characters to fighting Dead Rising-like psychopaths, you really never know what you are going to be doing from one mission to the next and it helps  set the more diverse nature of the Cyberpunk universe. I also recommend doing more side missions to help level up quicker and to get better weapons, and also certain side missions as mentioned are crucial for the ending I consider the best. However, the greatest flaw of the game in my opinion is the insane amount of combat options you do have. Earlier I mentioned it's great, but I was mostly referencing to it's gunplay. When it comes to quick hacks which are basically Watch Dogs-esque gameplay additions that you don't need, you can use your cyber abilities to burn enemies, reveal their location, stall their weapons, short circuit them and much more. This si great and all, but it isn't essential to the game. I played this game elsewhere before I bought my steam copy and I never used my quickhacks at all and relied solely on my weapons but this was mostly do to me forgetting I even had the ability or how to properly upgrade it. Now, I have found it very useful in my new playthrough, but now I find my main weapons have less use. Overall, I like that they give everyone the options of both as the hacks are more for stealth-type gameplay, but for me it makes the game feel a bit too easy, even though I am playing on normal, but even so I feel the game shouldn't feel like it is in easy mode on normal difficulty. Just a little nitpick, I'm sure you all would love the variety in the gameplay.Now, let's address the overall elephant in the room: the bugs. I have at times faced literal game breaking bugs that would force me to relaunch the game or reload a save to previous point, but more often than not, the main bugs are for laughs. From random T-posing NPCs to your car flying towards you when you call it, to sometimes even randomly spawning in the air or to immediately dying from getting grazed by a car; the bugs are endless but they make for amazing clips. In a way, while the bugs can get annoying at times, I feel like the bugs add character to an otherwise flat game at times, and by flat I mean the non-realistic nature of the some of the normal stuff in the game. Essentially what I'm saying is, is the bugs kinda make up for the non-GTA like atmosphere of the game, whereas once the bugs are fixed the game will kinda feel boring during exploration moments. It's kinda like the first Watch Dogs where the game punished you for even attempting to run over NPCS, and just ??????? ???? up for the hell of it. That to me just makes it feel flat, but it's not a big deal as long as you have missions to do.Overall my final verdict of the game is that the game they promised is basically there, but everything hasn't been polished yet. Basically, the game is like eating stale cereal but you ran out of milk a couple days ago, so you have to eat it dry, but once you buy fresh cereal and more milk, that great taste you know comes back in full force. So, based on that, I believe that once all the patches come in to fix the remaining bugs and more content is added to the game to make it feel realistic, I think in a way it could be a GTA competitor, but until that moment arrives, buy the game if you can handle it all like I have, or wait for the final polished release that I know will be an even better version of the game I played.

"I feel fortunate to have a machine powerful enough to play this game. I feel bad for those who are having issues, and I am frustrated for you all that CDPR has not resolved all of the issues so many are experiencing. That said, I am 11 hours into the game and I have not experienced any glitches that have taken me out of the experience at all so far. I recognize that I may be in the minority having a good experience with this game. I have a lot of great things to say about it. It is very atmospheric and there is a ton of minute details that have been incorporated into this game.

"As a big fan of the anime movies ""Ghost in the Shell"" and the series of the same name, the movie ""Blade Runner"", as well as the genre cyberpunk itself, I was very curious about what might be coming when I first saw the teaser for ""Cyberpunk 2077"" in 2013. But then it became quiet. Very quiet. The years passed and ""Cyberpunk 2077"" disappeared from my personal radar. I think it was in October 2016 when I played ""The Witcher 3 - Wild Hunt"" for the first time and I must confess to my shame that this was the first game of CDPR I played. And it was overwhelming for me. I loved it. The characters, the story, the graphic design, everything about this game delighted me. But I noticed that I couldn't bring myself to finish the game. Then in January 2017, I bought all the DLC I didn't already had so I could happily continue playing ""The Witcher"". After I finished ""Hearts of Stone"" and ""Blood and Wine"" was nearing the end, I had this feeling again that I would not finish the game.  ... I couldn't finish it ... because I didn't want it to be over.I compare this feeling for me, as with the ever-approaching end of a good book, which has so captivated me for days, that I was completely caught up in the story. Knowing that this story will soon be over makes me sad. And when I finish reading it, I am left with a strange emptiness. As an example, J.R.R.Tolkins ""The lord of the Rings"" or Stephen Kings ""The Stand""This feeling of emptiness also overtook me at the end of ""Blood and Wine"" from ""The Witcher"". And I delayed the end as much as possible, explored all the open question marks on the map, really searched everything, but at some point it could no longer be avoided. I tried once or twice to play again, but I couldn't. This story is told and over. Then in 2019, the E3 trailer for ""Cyberpunk 2077"" released and I wanted it. I wanted to play this game so bad. And for the first time in my now 40+ years of gaming (I started with Atari Home Pong and then Atari 2600), I pre-ordered a game and played it right on release day. And it grabbed me just as much as ""The Witcher - Wild Hunt"" did at the time.Well, and now I'm sitting here with the same dilemma with ""Cyberpunk 2077"". It's not necessarily the story of ""V."" this time. Or the stories of the characters I met that won't let me go. Even if these are partly very ""close to my heart"" (like Ciri in ""The Witcher""). To mention would be for example ""Takemura"" or ""Judy"" or also ""Evelyn"". Even ""Gerald ""Garry The Prophet"" Winkler"" has his ""place in my heart"". Rarely, really rarely, have I enjoyed spending time in a game world as much as I have in ""Night City"". I spent hours and hours just walking around in ""Night City"". Exploring every corner, climbing up here and there, or looking to see what's so interesting down there at the bridge. I've seen so many things, found Easter Eggs, read shards, and still haven't had enough. https://steamcommunity.com/app/1091500/discussions/0/3183488858469624527/As with ""The Witcher - Wild Hunt""(and a few other games), I don't want it to end. I have a Char that has grazed all the side missions and NCPD scanner gigs and is really just waiting to finally finish the story. But what have I done ? I have created a new Char and started all over again. I don't want to let it end.I hope so much that CDPR will release expansions of the caliber of ""Hearts of Stone"" and ""Blood and Wine"" that will keep me in ""Night City"" for a long, long time. Until then, I cannot and will not be able to finish this game. And I recommend it btw. :D",as a big fan of the anime movies ghost in the shell and the series of the same name the movie blade runner as well as the genre cyberpunk itself i was very curious about

"Constant crashing; almost no compatibility support for AMD processors and GPUs.The game released in a horrible state on launch, and every patch since launch has not only failed to fix many problems, but it's made the game even more of a mess.  In the latest 1.2 patch, I am unable to get past a specific cutscene in the game's prologue without a crash (corpo intro, after fainting in the bar), making the game literally unplayable.  This should never happen, especially three and a half months after launch.  I had so much respect for CDPR but this has been an absolute disaster.

"ill update this as more updates come out because more things are being added and addressed and we will eventually have expansions so that will be a thing to review in itself.Okay so i played this on release date on GOG, my first playthrough was about 100ish hours, really enjoyed it storywise, its honestly one of the best games ive played in that regard, the characters and dialogue are incredible IMO and the character questlines are the best part about it, especially Judy and Panam's which have easily become fan favourites for those who have played it.the game was obviously a massive mess on release, huge amount of bugs and performance issues and cut content, they have released a few patches since release as well as 6 free dlc's (7 more to go) and while the game is still in a better state than at launch, its still needs a lot of improvement performance and bug fixing wise and while the new patch has been a big step in the right direction im not sure it would be enough to say its fixed just yet.content wise im really looking forward to more, ive 100% it on my original playthrough and am currently in the middle of doing it again on male V on Steam and seeing the new texts and apartment interaction its not a huge thing especially to warrent another playthrough but ive been looking for a excuse to jump back in anyway and considering i loved that stuff in my original playthrough it gave me that small boost to jump back in, though i really can't wait for more story content and new game plus, hoping with the new patch i can buy all the cars and apartments because if i can ill likely end up doing it on new game plus with my original character, i really missed this game and i need more of the story especially with how it ends and the characters mean a lot so i need more romance content haha.things i feel the game needs:new game plusthe ability to reset attribute points (really need this for my original character because i can't max out skills)more story content

"????, this is where I wish steam had a neutral review option. I'm going to put this as a no for now, even if I do really enjoy the game, but the more I play the more I feel the facade of this open world slip. I went in with middling expectations, expecting a worse, but sci-fi Witcher 3, which I would have been fine with.Unfortunately, you can't interact with anything unless the game wants you to.You can't sit on chairs, you can't interact with any street vendor, the police AI (if you can even call it that) are pathetic. Cops spawn in behind you, and don't chase you. In fact, there is no driving AI at all. Test it yourself by parking a car in the middle of a road, and watch as they just sit there. Civilians just sit there cowering not running or anything. ??????? GTA 3 had this ???? figured out. Where did all the dev time go? Because it obviously wasn't in the open world. On top of that, the customization ??????? sucks. There is no barbers or plastic surgeons or anything. You literally *cannot* change your character at all apart from clothing past the start. Crafting is garbage and genuinely useless. Some perks are literally just a downside, like the auto dismantle junk. Junk sometimes is worth 750, so not something you want to dismantle.If you can get past all of that, you'll probably really enjoy it, and I'm kinda jealous. It's just all these issues combined just make the game feel empty and shallow to me.",this is where i wish steam had a neutral review option im going to put this as a no for now even if i do really enjoy the game but the more i play the more i feel the facade of this open world slip i went in with middling expectations expecting a worse but scifi witcher  which i would have been fine withunfortunately you cant interact with anything unless the game wants you toyou cant sit on chairs you cant interact with any street vendor the police ai if you can even call it that are pathetic cops spawn in behind you and dont chase you in fact there is no driving ai at all test it yourself by parking a car in the middle of a road and watch as they just sit there civilians just sit there cowering not running or anything  gta  had this  figured out where did all the dev time go because it obviously wasnt in the open world on top of that the customization  sucks there is no barbers or plastic surgeons or anything you literally cannot change your character at all apart from clothing past the start crafting is garbage and genuinely useless some perks are literally just a downside like the auto dismantle junk junk sometimes is worth  so not something you want to dismantleif you can get past all of that youll probably really enjoy it and im kinda jealous its just all these issues combined just make the game feel empty and shallow to me,wish steam neutral review option im going put even really enjoy game play feel facade open world slip went middling expectation expecting worse scifi witcher would fine withunfortunately cant interact anything unless game want toyou cant sit chair cant interact street vendor police ai even call pathetic cop spawn behind dont chase fact driving ai test parking car middle road watch sit civilian sit cowering running anything gta figured dev time go obviously wasnt open world top customization suck barber plastic surgeon anything literally change character apart clothing past start crafting garbage genuinely useless perk literally downside like auto dismantle junk junk sometimes worth something want dismantleif get past youll probably really enjoy im kinda jealous issue combined make game feel empty shallow,Positive

"Okay, so the game itself, the story? It is good, sucks you in. The characters in the game are believable, incredibly voice acted, especially V. Good audio, okay gameplay. Game overall is just okay at this moment. Game is lacking even basic game designs that were used even 20 years ago. Game has non existant A.I., every NPC is braindead, the gunplay is clunky as hell. There is no need to buy any of the cars since you get probably the best bikes you can from the story, even then, they are rarely used. By the way, none of the NPC's drive the bikes in the world. Cops will just spawn in front of you or behind you if you do something bad. No Cop chases or anything. Economy in the game is completely off the charts, you can't try every cyberware even if you finish everything the game offers, you can get couple of top tier at best. Crafting is tedious and completely unusable because of how rare crafting materials are. You maybe will be able to craft one Legendary item.The loot system is horrible, probably worst that i have ever seen in a while. You will spend half of the time looking at the ground collecting useless items. Weapon balance doesn't exist as well, some are completely useless and some are so broken it is not even funny.The skill tree is as boring as it gets, all you get 90% of the time is just stat increases. What is funny, there is a skill that makes enemies used as body shields take more damage, but you can't even use them as body shields.Cyberware is boring as it can be. Only interesting things are the augmentations to arms like mantis blade and other 3 things and probably the double jump. All other cyberware is again, a stat increase. Doesn't even change the looks of your character.Character creation is barebones and pointless. There are no ways to see your character apart in inventory or if you turn on the screenshot mode which is mediocre since it forces your character it set poses and not in game poses. But that makes sense, because animations for main character are beyond lazy and broken, you can see it in the shadows.The game is not an RPG, it is an linear action game, none of the dialog choices you make changes anything at all, none, you always end up at the same end. It is not really even action adventure because of how the story goes.Story itself is good but gets completely butchered by the terrible ending writing. Every ending contradicts whatever you tried to achieve in the main story. Some of them are bad but some of them are completely stupid compared to what we got in TW3. Endings even denies the actual Cyberpunk lore with DNA changes and neuron damage repair. It is just really, really bad writing at the end. The biggest issue and a feel of betrayal is the games ending choices. You have no choices, everything leads to similar outcomes no matter what you do during the game. And if you gonna be as involved and attached to characters, after finishing the game, you will be really depressed.I won't give it a score, because i don't think it matters. All I will say is, it is not worth at all. Once you realize how empty the world is and everything is okay at best, you will regret your purchase.",okay so the game itself the story it is good sucks you in the characters in the game are believable incredibly voice acted especially v good audio okay gameplay game overall is just okay at this moment game is lacking even basic game designs that were used even  years ago game has non existant ai every npc is braindead the gunplay is clunky as hell there is no need to buy any of the cars since you get probably the best bikes you can from the story even then they are rarely used by the way none of the npcs drive the bikes in the world cops will just spawn in front of you or behind you if you do something bad no cop chases or anything economy in the game is completely off the charts you cant try every cyberware even if you finish everything the game offers you can get couple of top tier at best crafting is tedious and completely unusable because of how rare crafting materials are you maybe will be able to craft one legendary itemthe loot system is horrible probably worst that i have ever seen in a while you will spend half of the time looking at the ground collecting useless items weapon balance doesnt exist as well some are completely useless and some are so broken it is not even funnythe skill tree is as boring as it gets all you get  of the time is just stat increases what is funny there is a skill that makes enemies used as body shields take more damage but you cant even use them as body shieldscyberware is boring as it can be only interesting things are the augmentations to arms like mantis blade and other  things and probably the double jump all other cyberware is again a stat increase doesnt even change the looks of your charactercharacter creation is barebones and pointless there are no ways to see your character apart in inventory or if you turn on the screenshot mode which is mediocre since it forces your character it set poses and not in game poses but that makes sense because animations for main character are beyond lazy and broken you can see it in the shadowsthe game is not an rpg it is an linear action game none of the dialog choices you make changes anything at all none you always end up at the same end it is not really even action adventure because of how the story goesstory itself is good but gets completely butchered by the terrible ending writing every ending contradicts whatever you tried to achieve in the main story some of them are bad but some of them are completely stupid compared to what we got in tw endings even denies the actual cyberpunk lore with dna changes and neuron damage repair it is just really really bad writing at the end the biggest issue and a feel of betrayal is

"It's still not what was promised close to a decade ago now. It has gotten better (as of 1.6) , but it is still very buggy and the greatest flaws have always been in the story. The main questline contains decent writing, but the game is very linear. Pretty much every choice that is not ""do you accept this quest"" or ""do you kill x person"" has absolutely no meaning and leads to the same dialogue\outcome. It's not really a true RPG. Likewise, combat can be fun but it also boils down to if you want to be a sneaky netrunner or go full David Martinez with a Sandevistan. In a lot of ways my opinion of this game is very similar to my opinion of Fallout 4. It's an enjoyable waste of time, but it's not very memorable and I doubt I'll be coming back to it in the future.

"Even if you dont take into consideration the bugs the game is not what cdpr promised us. First of all the game lacks tons of RPG elements, to a point where i wouldnt even consider it an RPG. The npc and police ai are horrendous, the gearing system is garbage, to a point where you have look like a clown in order to not get 1 shotted on hard difficulty, there is no vehicle customization whatsoever, the city feels dead there is literraly nothing to do, the majority of side quests are repetitive and boring consisting mainly of killing npc, rescuing npc or interacting with objects and the lore of those are for the most part written (fallout 76 flashbacks?). The main story is okay, but really short whereas you can finish the main story + all side quests(including the police ones) in roughly 60 ~ 70hrs. There is no replayability whatsoever.

"This game is boring. Basically a try at a semi futuristic Grand Theft Auto, there is very little to latch onto in this game in terms of an enjoyable experience. If you came to the game as a fan of the genre of Cyberpunk, you'll be the most disappointed as it has no meaningful connection to that genre. There's a small smattering of the visual cues of the genre that are washed out in grey and brown concrete monoliths that you can not enter or explore. You work for cops and every job you do seems to be needing to be explained on a walk and talk or car ride that would be boring in most movies and painfully boring in a video game. Now if you're a fan of the genre of RPG? Also very boring, the level system is hollow, there's basically no strong change from level to level and no upgrade you can purchase from XP that changes the style of play in a meaningful way.Overall a very boring game.",this game is boring basically a try at a semi futuristic grand theft auto there is very little to latch onto in this game in terms of an enjoyable experience if you came to the game as a fan of the genre of cyberpunk youll be the most disappointed as it has no meaningful connection to that genre theres a small smattering of the visual cues of the genre that are washed out in grey and brown concrete monoliths that you can not enter or explore you work for cops and every job you do seems to be needing to be explained on a walk and talk or car ride that would be boring in most movies and painfully boring in a video game now if youre a fan of the genre of rpg also very boring the level system is hollow theres basically no strong change from level to level and no upgrade you can purchase from xp that changes the style of play in a meaningful wayoverall a very boring game,game boring basically try semi futuristic grand theft auto little latch onto game term enjoyable experience came game fan genre cyberpunk youll disappointed meaningful connection genre there small smattering visual cue genre washed grey brown concrete monolith enter explore work cop every job seems needing explained walk talk car ride would boring movie painfully boring video game youre fan genre rpg also boring level system hollow there basically strong change level level upgrade purchase xp change style play meaningful wayoverall boring game,Negative

"Despite the launch and current bugs, there isn't many that is too game breaking and the storyline is rich, especially if you are one to do the side quests and side jobs as you traverse from one place to another. This gives you more time to level up skills and perks while progressing some interesting dialogues with Johnny. I've seen two endings so far, which you can achieve with < 20h of gameplay, but is not as exciting as what you could do with the other three endings if you take the time to do side quests and create bonds with other people. Also with the choices of romance with four different characters, it leaves a lot of storytelling that is revolved around your choices, and your choices do matter for at least 40% of the gameplay, creating different outcomes to different quests. Getting to the ending was quicker that I thought, which an intuition told me that I should focus more on the side jobs at the moment until I felt satiated, and lo and behold, the main quest where I continued from was two quests away to get an ending. Overall, I will keep playing to find all the endings and start a new game fresh to explore other options that I missed. Play the game how you want to at first and have your decisions dictate your gameplay. My run through is a Bladerunner build that by the time you do the side NCPD hustle and side jobs along the way to the quests you do, you'll be cutting everyone up like butter. Have yet to really tinker with the ARs and Handguns, but smart targeting and tech weapons are interesting to run and build as well. This game allows you to build a specific class that will enable you to completely be a god in many situations, but you cannot max all attributes as you please. You can definitely play fully stealth as a Netrunner or all out with weapons based on your patience levels, but exploring and doing all the side hustles are all part of the journey.With maxed out graphics, this game is beautiful and astonishing, allowing you to really enjoy and get the feel for Night City.

"I wish I could give a rating between recommend and not recommend. I came to this game not expecting much and... I still wasn't really satisfied. The RPG mechanics are barebones, side quests are not interesting, the city itself looks really cool, however, you quickly understand that it's not really alive, because the AI is really bad, people walking around are just not believable. Also, there are some gamebreaking bugs that can completely stop you from progressing and might require to rollback your saves in order to fix it. If you just want to pick this game at a deep deep discount for the main story, I recommend this game. If you expect some kind of revolutionary game - look elsewhere. CDProjekt really showed us all how easily you can overestimate yourself and underestimate your fan base and destroy your reputation after delivering the masterpiece called The Witcher 3. It's really sad that we won't ever see Cyberpunk 2077 to live up to its potential. The game should have never been release for at least another 3 years but here we are.Now, regarding the optimization, not sure if things much changed from the start, but with Ryzen 3700X, 16GB of RAM and RTX 2060 you can pretty much play this game on max settings with rock solid 60fps without any major issues. On the other hand, the game doesn't really look impressive or anything like that. It look okay, but it doesn't look impressive.All in all, if you would like an okay story line - go for it. If you expect a full fledged RPG - just skip it.

"I was a bit hesitant to buy the game after hearing about its optimization issues and the amount of bugs. I am glad I chose to buy Cyberpunk. My experience was by no means bug free, but the bugs didn't come close to ruining the game. I think this game's bugs make sense within the context of the plot so that makes them a bit more tolerable. I hope the devs patch the bugs soon and improve optimization, but I think alot of the public backlash against those two aspects of the game has been overblown.The plot was engaging and the gameplay very enjoyable. The game felt like Fallout sometimes, which is certainly a good thing in my book. The Perk system especially with regard to the quickhacking perks leaves something to be desired as some perks have very limited utility. There is a nice variety of weapons and clothing that allow for a good degree of character customization.The Main plot is of good length and quite cinematic in multiple points. There are alot, and I mean alot, of sidequests so it should take most players quite a bit to run through them. The game has some thought-provoking perspectives on Capitalism without being too preachy.

"I hate to leave a bad review for this, but I have to. There are just too many bugs and not enough substance to make up for them. Every single poignant or tense cutscene has been ruined by a goofy model glitch. I've been forced to reload old saves and lose progress due to game breaking bugs multiple times.The main story is interesting, but not groundbreaking. The world feels shallow and unresponsive, which is an enormous disappointment following the years of hype leading up to it. Same with character customization both at the start of the game and throughout it. Plus, I can replace my eyeballs but not get a haircut or change my makeup? Really? The traffic and NPC AI is practically nonexistant; just dolls on a rail, walking back and forth. I saw someone make a comparison to The Truman Show--that's about where it's at.In its current state, the game is just a mess and a letdown. I'll change this review down the line if it gets a serious overhaul, but for now this isn't worth the price.

"Alright, steam wants me to edit my review, so here we go. The game is now ""stable."" It's not optimized, it's not bug-free, but it finally, mostly, works. 6 months after launch. Yay.The game Cyberpunk 2077 is most reminiscent of is Fallout 4. Like F4, it was launched hopelessly broken. Like F4, it was launched as an ""RPG"" that relies almost entirely on stealth and/or combat which is nonetheless about as deep and engaging as a kiddie pool in a Nevada summer's heat. Like F4, it eventually got fixed to be playable - but that's it, just playable.Unlike F4, this game didn't come out in 2015 on the same game engine that provided Fallout 3 in 2011. And unlike F4, there's no creation kit so the community can finish CDPR's game for them.Here's the bottom line: this game was supposed to be the ""premiere next generation RPG."" Like how Skyrim brought us into the modern Western RPG era in 2011, 2077 was supposed to be that next big leap, the next attempt to raise the bar and push the formula further. But the truth of the matter is, the only thing that separates this game from the 360 console era is its graphics, seamless loading times and release date.In most respects for what you'd now call a ""traditional"" western RPG, 2077 has moved embarassingly backwards in almost every respect. Weapon variety, even at a cosmetic level, tops out at around 24 total weapon skins, and 12 total weapons. The world has no minigames, no dynamic scenery, not even a functional way to park your ??????? car without blocking traffic, which itself has no penalties or consequences - cars will just stack up behind you, forever. Cosmetic customization is nonexistent outside of character creation for a protagonist you will literally never see except in mirrors, while character customization boils down to 1 of 3 ""flavors"" that essentially boil down to stealth, hacking, or your preferred mode of open combat. Compared to the TTRPG the game is based on, V's options in-game are hilariously linear,  with most side missions boiling down to a ""go here > kill/sneak/hack past this"" loop that's copy-pasted to the point of feeling like an UbiClone.Though what V does have to say is well written and interesting, the charismatic approach to the game is virtually nonexistent, athletics are either pointless or infuriatingly limited, and of the game's 3 backgrounds, none are relevant except in fringe cases - in fact, what choices you make with V, from their background to their appearance to the actual decisions you make in missions - basically don't matter at all.The game itself is also laughably, pathetically braindead, even at its hardest difficulties. The melee approach in particular allows V to dominate with virtually no effort - acquiring a sword at the start of the game and taking the corresponding skills will allow you to defeat anything short of a tank, while the consumable-based healing system is not only completely busted, not only turns V virtually immortal, but completely destroys any immersion that the game could hope to achieve. The game reinforces this by the AI being dumb as bricks, both civilian and enemy. Cars drive on fixed paths and often get stuck or stop for no reason, civilians are functionally background props and enemies are, at best, about as smart as Skyrim's, which came out 10 years ago.Night City itself is beautiful, but utterly pointless. Sex shops are on every street corner, you can't enter most businesses, and in a world that's taking so much pride in its appearance and variety, there's basically nothing worth seeing. It's cool that CDPR put so much time into making sure that every alleyway had its own unique trash configuration, but seriously - you couldn't have maybe trimmed down the world into 3 interesting districts, instead of a map the size of San Francisco with nothing interesting or engaging happening in it?Where the city is worth exploring, it discourages it at every turn - invisible walls, absurd geometry and clunky climbing physics mean that even in the rare genuine opportunity to find a new angle, the game just gets buggier and buggier while you do it.The game is carried by its characters... but the characters are off-screen for 99% of the time - even the ??????? protagonist, that YOU PLAY AS will go hours without speaking as you grind out copy-paste ???????? missions via text message. And the unvoiced part doesn't even bother me - but WHY BY TEXT? I could write most of the side mission content for a single district in the space of 8 hours. Why, in a game with such an amazing cast of characters, are virtually none of them used or relevant for 95% of the game's content or time?And of course, the bugs. This ????'s still a mess, 6 months later. Gonna leave it at that.What depresses me the most is that it's SO CLOSE TO BEING GOOD. Why are the pinball machines modeled in such detail, yet I'm not able to play them? Why are there fully animated arcade cabinets that you can't interact with? In many cases, the linearity even seems deliberate! Why is it that with every backstory prologue presenting V with a different mode of transportation, you ALWAYS START WITH THE SAME CAR?But as it is, it's not good. It's mediocre at best - a 60-hour romp through a vivid depiction of a dead world, wider than the eye can see (literally) yet so shallow you've experienced everything in the game after 10 hours. And barring a No Man's Sky level of commitment and patching, or a Bethesda-style, publicly accessible modding kit, that's not something that's going to change.What an absolute disappointment.",alright

characters are offscreen for  of the time  even the  protagonist that you play as will go hours without speaking as you grind out copypaste  missions via text message and the unvoiced part doesnt even bother me  but why by text i could write most of the side mission content for a single district in the space of  hours why in a game with such an amazing cast of characters are virtually none of them used or relevant for  of the games content or timeand of course the bugs this s still a mess  months later gonna leave it at thatwhat depresses me the most is that its so close to being good why are the pinball machines modeled in such detail yet im not able to play them why are there fully animated arcade cabinets that you cant interact with in many cases the linearity even seems deliberate why is it that with every backstory prologue presenting v with a different mode of transportation you always start with the same carbut as it is its not good its mediocre at best  a hour romp through a

Sure there isn't much ""which weapon will do more damage to a certain enemy,"" but the I found the weapon variety very interesting. Overall, this is a very good game and I would totally recommend it.",i love this game i can see where everyone is coming from saying its too buggy and the game was released before it really should have been i played this game twice and both times i found little to no bugs although i have seen game play with bugs the story is absolutely amazing the open world missions and side missions are great and the controls are fairly easy to understand the combat sometimes can feel a bit slow if there are many enemies but the weapon variety is very diverse sure there isnt much which weapon will do more damage to a certain enemy but the i found the weapon variety very interesting overall this is a very good game and i would totally recommend it,love game see everyone coming saying buggy game released really played game twice time found little bug although seen game play bug story absolutely amazing open world mission side mission great control fairly easy understand combat sometimes feel bit slow many enemy weapon variety diverse sure isnt much weapon damage certain enemy found weapon variety interesting overall good game would totally recommend,Positive
"I really hope they pull a No Man's Sky on this; so much wasted potential...The world is certainly beautiful and expansive, but it feels empty and uninspiring. The only buildings you can enter are ones relevant to the missions and, although they're full of people, there's no interaction with anyone and all the NPCs will ever do is tell you to ???? off. One of the things that made the original Deus Ex so great were all the little asides that didn't have anything to do with the main story, they were just just there to flesh out the worlld. Cyberpunk lacks this completely.My other gripe is that this game is in no way ""next gen"". It's a very standard FPS RPG and has little difference to something like Skyrim or Fallout, except for its setting and the fact it's nowhere near as good as either of these. Boring, uninspired dialogue, boring uninspiring characters (except for Jackie), pretty lacklustre main story.

"Unfortunately a let down from CDPR. A lifeless world with a braindead AI, that can't even walk in a strait line. A unmotivated and boring story, after you are 6 hours into the game. Bad side-quests that are definitely not worth your time and can't compare to the side quests of Witcher 3 or GTA 5. You can't even do activitys, like gambling or playing some sort of minigame like gwent. Oh yeah you can participate in a couple of street races, with a broken AI, so that's fun right? The game is still filled with game breaking bugs, even after almost 2 months after the release and after one of the ""main"" patches, where CDPR promised to fix major parts of the game. And to top it all of the game is one of the worst optimized games I ever played and we don't want to talk about all the lies that CDPR told the consumers before the release. So yeah definitely not worth your  time at the moment, don't listen to all the fanboys in the discussions that praise the game like it's the best game of all time, because it's not. We were promised a game that will bring new innovations into the open world genre and bring so many new features, and we just got a lifeless shell of a game.

"First of all, It's a fun game.However it's still has its share of bugs and in-game loading times are horrible at some moments.The biggest downside for me and the reason why it's a negative review is the lack of the attributes respec option.You can respec your perk points but not your attribute points, wich is ridiculously stupid.Devs, you can't expect a new player to know what route he is going to take in the game. And even then mistakes can be made.I've played for about 50 hours on this single save file only to find out that my attributes (wich I just put in there because I thought I could reset them, wich isn't that crazy of an idea.) are set in stone.Now I have to download a mod to be able to reset my attribute points since I'm not about to start a new playthrough after playing and grinding for almost 2 days in playtime.

"This is one of those games which is really great in some ways but in other ways is problematic. I don't wanna give a full review here, so here's some quick notes. Some Bad Things- the minimap doesn't show enough when driving at speed, and looking in the corner of the screen while driving ""hides"" the scenery from my attention so I have little memory of what the city looks like. It's the same kind of problem as Fallout 3 had, where you navigate by staring at a small part of the screen. The pacing of the game is garbage, especially how you lose your car at the worst possible time (when the city should be fully opened to you). Combat and the mechanics of the game in general are weak. From what I've read there aren't any endings to the game that I'll find really satisfying. Bugs and glitchiness are present but have not been too problematic for me, the worst being that I've been stuck in place a couple of times (such as when leaving camera control). Some Good Things- it's super immersive, and the quality of the writing is great. Certainly 10x better than what you get from Bethesda. The game pushes boundaries and has some very dark quests, which I think will be good for the video game industry as a whole. I don't see myself playing this game numerous times, but it's worth the visit at least once.",this is one of those games which is really great in some ways but in other ways is problematic i dont wanna give a full review here so heres some quick notes some bad things the minimap doesnt show enough when driving at speed and looking in the corner of the screen while driving hides the scenery from my attention so i have little memory of what the city looks like its the same kind of problem as fallout  had where you navigate by staring at a small part of the screen the pacing of the game is garbage especially how you lose your car at the worst possible time when the city should be fully opened to you combat and the mechanics of the game in general are weak from what ive read there arent any endings to the game that ill find really satisfying bugs and glitchiness are present but have not been too problematic for me the worst being that ive been stuck in place a couple of times such as when leaving camera control some good things its super immersive and the quality of the writing is great certainly x better than what you get from bethesda the game pushes boundaries and has some very dark quests which i think will be good for the video game industry as a whole i dont see myself playing this game numerous times but its worth the visit at least once,one game really great way way problematic dont wan na give full review here quick note bad thing minimap doesnt show enough driving speed looking corner screen driving hide scenery attention little memory city look like kind problem fallout navigate staring small part screen pacing game garbage especially lose car worst possible time city fully opened combat mechanic game general weak ive read arent ending game ill find really satisfying bug glitchiness present problematic worst ive stuck place couple time leaving camera control good thing super immersive quality writing great certainly x better get bethesda game push boundary dark quest think good video game industry whole dont see playing game numerous time worth visit least,Positive

"First of all, the recommended specs are a bit misleading. The recommended specs are for 30 FPS definitely not 60 FPS.

I am running a 1660 TI, i5 9400F 2.9 GHz 6 Core, and 32 GB of Corsair Dominator 2666 MHz. I have had zero crashes, and the input is smooth. I have seen minor dips into low 60s when going into intensive areas  (e.g. Clubs, first time loading in for the day, etc.), but is quickly resolved within seconds back to the 70-80 FPS.Story so far seems pretty dope, and I really like the fact that I can treat it as a sandbox, or treat it as a linear story telling game; the choice is mine. I definitely recommend it as of right now, and as a note, the Nvidia Drivers definitely made a lot of the graphics more stable. If Cyberpunk as a theme is your jam, pick it up now. If you like and support CD Projekt Red, I would also recommend picking it up now.

"There's almost nothing good about this game.My initial review was negative and unfortunately so will be this one, after 80 hours of playtime and actually finishing the story.Interesting, although not making much sense from urbanistic standpoint city, really good soundtrack, good voice acting, except for Keanu, I hate how bland his voicelines were, but maybe that was the idea to show Silverhand as sociopathic terrorist with no emotion besides anger.Many core/essential components of this game are missing and I doubt CD Projekt RED will ever fix them. It would require them to literally rewrite half of this game. Also most of the promised features were lies.I consider the story pretty shallow, lackluster and uninspired, but some players seem to actually enjoy it. I didn't feel any attachment to any character, including V. I honestly didn't care what happened to any of them.The RPG aspect is non-existent. This is a very linear game and most of your choices don't matter at all.There's no Intelligence in Artificial Intelligence. The AI cars drive on defined paths and will stop and stand forever if there's anything in their way, they drive through obstacles, spawn out of nowhere, disappear when you're not looking, stop for no reason in the middle of the highway. The drivers will not respond to anything. You can literally point a gun at them and they will just keep staring at you, while holding the wheel. There are no police chases or any chases for that matter besides the scripted ones. Police will forget you did anything wrong as soon as you go around the corner. You cannot actually talk to pedestrians.There's no interactivity in this city. Through 80 hours of my playtime I haven't done a single mission stealthily, it literally doesn't matter how you do them,  you can just rambo/john wick everything.Same goes for ""hacking"", which is literally selecting an item from a menu, I don't think I've actually used it on purpose through my whole playthrough once. Not that the game would actually require it at any point, besides tutorial.Gangs don't matter, like at all, even though CD Projekt claimed they would.Your clothes don't matter, besides giving you more stats. Loot system in general is pathetic.Your street cred doesn't matter, besides unlocking more gigs.Crafting doesn't matter, you can go through the whole game without crafting a single item.The balance is non-existent. When you start the game, the enemies are in full bullet sponge mode, you can empty 3 clips in their heads and they will still run at you with their melee weapons. After few hours you will one shot everything, including cyberpsychos, which were meant to be challenging.Most of the doors are locked and you cannot open them at any point, most buildings are completely empty inside, you cannot enter them, unless you manage to get under the map (which isn't very complicated).There's not much cyberpunk in cyberpunk, the tech hasn't changed much between 2020 and 2077, the cars are still gas powered for some reason, there's no artificial reality, you cannot fly drones or use some advanced robots (besides one mission where you literally point and click on predefined points where the bot should go). You cannot fly anything, even though there are plenty of AVs flying above the city.Driving is atrocious, the cars feel very floaty, the mini-map or rather micro-map is incredibly useless in terms of driving navigation.There is no balance between your earnings and price items. You can duplicate items and farm infinite money. They still haven't patched that.Sometimes it will corrupt your save files if they go above 8MB in size, the support article claims, that ""maybe"" they will increase that ""in one of the future patches"", I'm not even joking - https://support.gog.com/hc/en-us/articles/360016743298-Cyberpunk-2077-Saved-data-is-damaged-and-cannot-be-loaded-The ""quality"" of Cyberpunk 2077 is simply atrocious, it feels like very early alpha/early access title. Some bugs are visual, some will completely block you from progressing the game without reloading the save/restarting the game. It's simply unacceptable for me at this price level. That's why I have refunded this on my xbox, unfortunately steam didn't let me refund it after just 4 hours of playtime.The marketing campaign of this game has been made out of lies and CD Projekt RED management should actually take full responsibility for this ???? show, instead of releasing more pointless statements for the investors and crunching the team even more. There's so much more missing/bad in this game, but I cannot be bothered to list all of it, just like the management couldn't be bothered to let the devs make at least a decent rpg game.

"Cyberpunk 2077, what is there to say. We were promised a trove of features. It was pitched as being the next immersive, open world RPG.It is definitely an immersive, open world experience. It is not an RPG. It is a gutted RPG.Pros:- Visually beautiful- Story is gripping and characters are engaging generally speaking- Side missions aren't all trashCons- No police/law system: they just spawn in increasingly stronger hordes. Crimes are instantly detected regardless of context. No police chases, you can escape by changing vertical distance or running/driving around 500m.- Gunplay is basic, nothing special or new.- Cyberware is shallow and barely useful in most regards- Scanning/eye wear is _severely_ under utilized.- Crafting/gear is just basic pistol, rifle, shotty, LMG and sniper. Basically highest DPS wins- Melee is awkward and basically feels like a shotgun with 2m range.- Map is amazing screenshot material, but virtually no interiors not crucial to missions, no social/down time minigames- NPCs in the game world are brainless, on rails two-trick ponies. They have one or two dialog pieces, the variation in NPC appearance and 'personality' is so repetative you will feel like you're in clone town.RPG mean's roleplaying game, and in truth you play a 'role' and it's a game. But it's not in the genre of RPG. It should be and it clearly was intended to be. There is a lot of obvious indications that deeper game mechanics and game play was planned and cut.The bugs I can live with, I'd expect the mature industry of software development would be churning out innovative and mind blowing games, instead we get bottom of the barrel, lowest common denominator mechanics and pretty much no substance.Even if they fix this with DLC and patches, it's not worth 60 euros, wait for sale WITH DLC included.Sad because it had so much potential, but it ultimately was the wrong people to make it.",cyberpunk  what is there to say we were promised a trove of features it was pitched as being the next immersive open world rpgit is definitely an immersive open world experience it is not an rpg it is a gutted rpgpros visually beautiful story is gripping and characters are engaging generally speaking side missions arent all trashcons no policelaw system they just spawn in increasingly stronger hordes crimes are instantly detected regardless of context no police chases you can escape by changing vertical distance or runningdriving around m gunplay is basic nothing special or new cyberware is shallow and barely useful in most regards scanningeye wear is severely under utilized craftinggear is just basic pistol rifle shotty lmg and sniper basically highest dps wins melee is awkward and basically feels like a shotgun with m range map is amazing screenshot material but virtually no interiors not crucial to missions no socialdown time minigames npcs in the game world are brainless on rails twotrick ponies they have one or two dialog pieces the variation in npc appearance and personality is so repetative you will feel like youre in clone townrpg means roleplaying game and in truth you play a role and its a game but its not in the genre of rpg it should be and it clearly was intended to be there is a lot of obvious indications that deeper game mechanics and game play was planned and cutthe bugs i can live with id expect the mature industry of software development would be churning out innovative and mind blowing games instead we get bottom of the barrel lowest common denominator mechanics and pretty much no substanceeven if they fix this with dlc and patches its not worth  euros wait for sale with dlc includedsad because it had so much potential but it ultimately was the wrong people to make it,cyberpunk say promised trove feature pitched next immersive open world rpgit definitely immersive open world experience rpg gutted rpgpros visually beautiful story gripping character engaging generally speaking side mission arent trashcons policelaw system spawn increasingly stronger horde crime instantly detected regardless context police chase escape changing vertical distance runningdriving around gunplay basic nothing special new cyberware shallow barely useful regard scanningeye wear severely utilized craftinggear basic pistol rifle shotty lmg sniper basically highest dp win melee awkward basically feel like shotgun range map amazing screenshot material virtually interior crucial mission socialdown time minigames npc game world brainless rail twotrick pony one two dialog piece variation npc appearance personality repetative feel like youre clone townrpg mean roleplaying game truth play role game genre rpg clearly intended lot obvious indication deeper game mechanic game play planned cutthe bug live id expect mature industry software development would churning innovative mind blowing game instead get bottom barrel lowest common denominator mechanic pretty much substanceeven fix dlc patch worth euro wait sale dlc includedsad much potential ultimately wrong people make,Negative

"First of all I have 70h in the game, I've done every ending along with all the side stories for each character. The game itself is beautiful and one of the most detailed cities you can play in right now. Every road throughout Night city is filled with how I imagined a future dystopian city would look like. The major issue is behind the beautiful city is just a boring, lifeless mess of random activities. There are many side gigs to complete and side missions; while plenty and spread out throughout the city, they are just the same repetitive missions with no actual interaction. The side missions themselves with many of the characters you meet through the story are fantastic and are definitely worth doing. Everyone of the character side missions are all uniquely memorable with worthy rewards for doing them; you can either get a powerful gun, jacket, even cars for doing them. After doing these missions you can tell you develop a bit with each of those character, combined with more conversations, text messages, and even in the end credits each of those characters will either have something to say based off your ending decision and makes it feel the impact of it. Despite having those characters the world its self is just empty. The AI is simply a joke either in combat or just the casual NPC's, the police are an absolute clown show with only ONE actual instance with a police chase and its during one off Kerry Eurodyne quest. Why they decided that instead of the police just teleporting where ever the player is instead of using the abundance of police vehicles, or AV's that they even show using in the beginning of the game just baffles me and iust lazy.The customization in this game is also another joke compared to absolutely every other RPG out there. The only thing you can customize is your body in the beginning and that's it besides the clothing. The vehicles you get are already set colors or designs and can never be changed, your apartment is static and never changing, weapons only have 2 slots for attachments, clothing is just as they are when you get them. You cant even get cybernetics despite the game heavily empathizing them all throughout the game and even the ripperdoc choices. The only upgrades you can get that have a mild impact on looks is your arm upgrades, everything else is just behind the scenes, no chrome, or limp replacements despite the ads throughout Night City. I really wish wish they went further with customization, just being able to change the color of a vehicle, or the ripperdoc could function as a body modification area they they should.Overall, I still do recommend then game but probably either on sale or when the game actually gets some real updates that can actually improve the lifelessness of the game. The game is absolutely worth going through if you are into the whole cyberpunk feel and you will look over any bugs that you get because you just want to keep playing. Throughout my entire playthrough I never encountered many bugs, mainly visual. The performance for me was fine, I have a RTX2070s and i7 8700k, never dipped below 60 at 1440p but that is with DLSS enabled.",first of all i have h in the game ive done every ending along with all

This is the first time I find myself writing a review because I just can't get past the disappointment I have for this game. $60 for a finalized game? From a large company? With this many bugs? As many other reviews state this game is literally unplayable. I have had to reinstall several times and go into the file libraries and fix broken code constantly just to get the game to even start up. How can such a large company release such a poorly executed game and still think this is worth $60.... I shouldn't have to wait for any major patches to fix this game so it's even remotely playable but yet here I am. Writing a review on this horrible product I stupidly paid for.

"I've played through the game multiple times at this point - trying different endings and roles. All in all I think the game is solid.  It's not perfect and never will be. It has it's bugs, it has some fairly shallow elements, but on the whole it's an enjoyable story with a combat/hacking/crafting system that is fun. I say that  because so many games (especially in the crafting department) throw far too much complexity into the whole process.  I've suffered through many of the bugs, yet even with the game-crashers, I've enjoyed this game since launch day. Each fix just reaffirms the company's commitment to making this game work, and my happiness in voting for their work with my dollars.  I also have to throw out a huge thank you to the wonderful modding community. Y'all keep this game interesting and vibrant, with new looks, items, and toys :)  I cannot wait to see new expansions come out to grow the story, and I can't wait to see what sort of story campaigns the modding community creates as well.  All in all I think this game has a promising future.So go out there and be a Night City Legend, choomba!

"Unless the upcoming patch somehow fixes this entire game, I can't recommend it. It looks, plays, and feels like an Ubisoft game from 2010. In fact, at times I get the vibe of playing a COD campaign... Gunplay is nothing special, at worst feels like a Destiny or Borderlands bullet-sponge shooter. Stealth is par for the course, sneak behind an enemy and choke him out or break his neck, then throw him in a dumpster. Hacking is practically Watch Dogs made over. Terrible optimization even with top-of-the-line hardware. This game would still be somewhat mediocre even if a small studio made it. Ubisoft would be ripped apart for releasing something of this quality. For CDPR to claim that ""Witcher 3 was good exercise"" for Cyberpunk and the literal lies they told us ""each NPC will have his own schedule"" -- this is unacceptable quality.The same CDPR fanboys who inundated us with ""it's fine if they delay it half a dozen times, I'd rather have a polished game than a rushed one"" are now the ones saying ""a game this size is GONNA have bugs"". There's nothing wrong with being upset for receiving a broken game. FYI, CDPR have gone back and are now claiming this once ""RPG"" is an ""Action Adventure"" game.

"I'm tired of getting partially finished games that take a year of patches to become what was originally offered. Incredibly buggy and an overall frustrating experience. Sucks because i really enjoy the game but the glaring issues can make it almost unplayable. So much buildup to get let down again by devs. Just release what you have and apologize later. Why bother giving costumers who are paying $60+ for this overhyped project a FINISHED game?

"Ok, here my full review. Finished the game in around 80 hours with all side mission stuff.First off, I absolutely love everything about the game. I knew this game will definitely be something I will like. I always wanted a Cyberpunk GTA kind of game and then even in First Person? Hell yeah, sign me up.Probably a mix of Grand Theft Auto, Deus Ex and Far Cry describes the game the best. While it is no hardcore RPG, such as Fallout New Vegas, it definitely tries to add many elements of more complex RPGs into the game, while not going totally overboard and still trying to also serve the more casual gamer. Some choices matter and your backstory can also change up some dialogue.I really like the story. Yes, it is not as good as Witcher but the lore makes up for a lot of it. The background lore the game creates is insane, there are TONS of readable texts ingame and even other items such as a lorebook from the collectors edition expand on it tons. I knew this game is based off on some old board game but that it goes that deep, damn.The world is really stunning. Everything feels so alive and the art style such as city skylines and advertising is just stellar. The same goes for the amazing sound. All aspects including effects, score and radio. I don't think I have ever heard a better audio work. Music alone is just the best for me. Industrial, Techno and IDM are just my type of thing. Happy they didn't just go with Synthwave music. Still waiting for a FULL radio soundtrack release though.The graphics are absolutely stunning. Rarely seen anything better. Nothing is better than driving through the streets with your car and seeing the reflections of the neon glimmering world. Even more so with RTX. Sadly all this comes at a very performance intensive price. Almost no rig can handle the game with full effects @ 60FPS right now. DLSS saves the games performance but this only works on RTX 2000 and up.The FPS gameplay is really good and I am happy to say that. I never liked Witchers gameplay. Felt too average and stiff. But this game here? Totally different. FPS mechanics remind me a lot of Far Cry. Melee gameplay could be a bit more polished though. And since we are at this part now, let's talk about the darker sides of the game.It is obvious the game was rushed for release, heck, CDPR even admitted that. Sadly it does show in some aspects, but a lot less so on PC in my opinion. The melee gameplay could be more polished. It just doesn't feel that smooth and always the same kill animations are getting boring after a while. There is only one for every kind of melee weapon. In case you wonder, I made a beserker melee build. I did also use guns here and there but 80% was melee only. Guns feel almost perfect but melee is just average.Other things that annoyed the heck out of me are explosive props such as barrels. They are almost everywhere and they will almost always kill you if you are a bit closer to them. I died like 50 times in this game. 45 times was because of random explosive props. Just another aspect that shows this game was rushed and the devs barely had time to play it themselves. Maybe it was also my melee gameplay though. Either way, the explosive damage should be reduced.Aside of that, the hacking minigame also went on my nerves. I did use it like 200 times or something like that and it is only one. Repetitive and boring. But I guess those are all aspects I could complain about.Anyway. To not overdo it again with my review, here now some positive and negative aspects at a glance.Positive:- Graphics are stunning- Sound FX are just spot on, especially advertising and such- Immersive locations- Stellar art style- Interesting story and side missions- Interesting and believable characters- Keanu Reeves is breathtaking- Good gameplay- Game has tons of video and other options including full 21:9 support- Soundtrack both score and radio is out of this world, LOVING IT!- The collectors edition is the best I ever unpacked, seriouslyNegative:- Really performance demanding- Goddarn explosive props- A few small bugs such as items not being pickupable or enemies glitching into objects- Some aspects such as melee gameplay or hacking minigames feel repetitive and unpolishedSo yeah. Easily GOTY for me as it is. I honestly cannot await the updates and DLC content. Really happy with this game. Was worth every penny I dropped on it. 9/10It is a bit of a shame that CDPR released it like that because it could have been even better. Aside of that also many people don't seem to have the experience I have, especially last gen console gamers. Shame. This product is pure art and I wouldn't have minded to wait some months more. I guess the managers of CDPR were in for a nice cash in. I think that is a first for CDPR, maybe it is good to have some negative feedback for once but then again... I think most people absolutely blow the whole thing out of proportion calling it a bad game or whatever. The whole net is full of people ???????? on it and most of them didn't even play the game and just say what others say. I am tired of this crap. Such public outcries are just sad but oh well. I hope it won't hurt the game on the long run.",ok here my full review finished the game in around  hours with all side mission stufffirst off i absolutely love everything about the game i knew this

It obviously concerns only the #PCMR version of the game!That being said, please keep in mind that by the time I write these lines, I have only obtained one of the ending available for the game, I'm also far from having finished all the secondary quests and contracts...Let's spit it out right away: Cyberpunk 2077 is a great game!Sure the main story may seem a little short, yes we may have to deal with bugs from time to time,aye the game is greedy in resources, and the contracts are rather similar...Thus with these flaws, how can it be a great game then?Because it would be unfair to discard all its strengths!The way the main story is written, as well as how side quests are dealt with, is top notch,these said side quests can have a strong impact on the end of the game too.The artistic direction is licked, technically the game is really beautiful if you have a decent setup.Gameplay wise, it is very pleasant, and no the driving is not catastrophic... We are not in a racing-sim.Nightcity is marvelous, it wouldn't be silly to consider this city as one of the main characters of the game, clearly.Finally, the soundtrack is not outdone, as well as the sound effects, the music, or the dubbing... Great job!The game is definitely worth it, and unless you’re allergic to the universe, it would be a shame to miss it.19/20: A great game on which I would have liked more possible interactions with its universe, whether with passers-by, more shops/bars that we could visit and spend our Eddies in.",my review doesnt include any spoiler nor anything that could spoil your adventure it obviously concerns only the pcmr version of the gamethat being said please keep in mind that by the time i write these lines i have only obtained one of the ending available for the game im also far from having finished all the secondary quests and contractslets spit it out right away cyberpunk  is a great gamesure the main story may seem a little short yes we may have to deal with bugs from time to timeaye the game is greedy in resources and the contracts are rather similarthus with these flaws how can it be a great game thenbecause it would be unfair to discard all its strengthsthe way the main story is written as well as how side quests are dealt with is top notchthese said side quests can have a strong impact on the end of the game toothe artistic direction is licked technically the game is really beautiful if you have a decent setupgameplay wise it is very pleasant and no the driving is not catastrophic we are not in a racingsimnightcity is marvelous it wouldnt be silly to consider this city as one of the main characters of the game clearlyfinally the soundtrack is not outdone as well as the sound effects the music or the dubbing great jobthe game is definitely worth it and unless you’re allergic to the universe it would be a shame to miss it a great game on which i would have liked more possible interactions with its universe whether with passersby more shopsbars that we could visit and spend our eddies in,review doesnt include spoiler anything could spoil adventure obviously concern pcmr version gamethat said please keep mind time write line obtained one ending available game im also far finished secondary quest contractslets spit right away cyberpunk great gamesure main story may seem little short yes may deal bug time timeaye game greedy resource contract rather similarthus flaw great game thenbecause would unfair discard strengthsthe way main story written well side quest dealt top notchthese said side quest strong impact end game toothe artistic direction licked technically game really beautiful decent setupgameplay wise pleasant driving catastrophic racingsimnightcity marvelous wouldnt silly consider city one main character game clearlyfinally soundtrack outdone well sound effect music dubbing great jobthe game definitely worth unless ’ allergic universe would shame miss great game would liked possible interaction universe whether passersby shopsbars could visit spend eddy,Positive

"1st the game is great overall, visual, voice acting, Keanu Reeves, and story. Now the issues are obvious if you've seen the reports, bugs everywhere. Not to the point of crashing your game, but it affects the AI during combat sometimes making them do nothing thus making it easy to walk up to them to punch them to raise your brawling skill. The gameplay can be ruined a bit because of that, but with time a bulk of the bugs should be squashed by the DE. What won't get fixed is the ending, I won't tell how it ended but the paths no matter what I choose ended up being the same and didn't care for it (to put it nicely). I say wait about 6 months to get this game then you can enjoy the game to the fullest. Their is no New Game Plus, odds are they'll add that later on (hopefully since I want to play the game doing things differently). Also if your a parent, don't get this for your kid unless he/she is mature enough to handle nudity.Update: Played the other options for the ending.

But god, after some time then all of that magic and sparkle wears off and I'm stuck feeling like what I played could have been so SO much ??????? better. Over all, my biggest complaint is that it doesn't feel like you're playing V's/your story; it feels like your A main character, but not THE main character, that goes to Silverhand. My second biggest complaint is the lack of meaningful choices in the game, and if you only play through the game once you probably wont notice it but otherwise it really quickly becomes pretty obvious and that really ??????? pissed me off. I mean this game was being touted as a BIG choice based RPG, it was supposed to be a glimmer of the old golden days of Mass Effect and the like, but past the surface it's all a facade.Now it breaks my heart to leave a bad review on this game, because I liked it -- as I said, it was fun. And there are glimmers EVERYWHERE in the game that showed that many people making this game really wanted to make this perfect RPG with choices and super customization, ya know, all the bell and whistles, and have us as V be the center point.

"Just simple list of aspects I like/dislike until I ""finish"" the gameMap - Probably one of the best cities I have ever been in. It doesnt feel like some boring ass grid-system city design. There is verticality, imperfect road designs, and it just feels NATURAL. Graphics - This game looks ??????? beautiful. I am playing with full RTX and this game just looks great.Gunplay - If you compare gunplay to destiny then this game will lose. However, it is more than good enough and is executed fine. It won't blow your hat off but it is FAR from bad. (note: the sens right now just feels off. Like there is mouth smoothing. I can't quite figure it out but its just a little off)Atmosphere - Idk how to put this in words but the city and the areas surrounding have distinct ""vibes"". You can tell when you are in a rougher part of town and when you are in luxury. It feels alive when its suppose to and ""dead"" when its suppose to.Music Amazing. Radio stations are great and the base soundtrack fits the scenes perfectly. Props for the OSTSide Quests As you would expect, side quests are amazing. Some of them feel like their own main stories.  I highly recommend you complete them and tbh if you purposely choose not too, then you are missing out.Story - So far the story has been what I expected. I did not expect some deep level thinking and a story about what it means to be human. I was expecting a story where you just ""experience"" the city and the characters take you on a journey.Characters - All perfectly voice acted (the ones I have ENCOUNTERED). I can't think of an AVA (bl3) in this game so far. Theres no character I wish wasn't in the game.Main Character - (MALE V) I never expected me to deeply care about V and how HE's feeling. I am more playing it like I am the character playing through a vessel. If that makes any sense. Don't hate me but I just couldn't give a ???? about geralt for the first half of witcher 3 so this could be like that but I have to yet to care about V like characters from other games. Thats OK to me, it hasn't taken the experience down for me.Johnny Silverhand - Skillup claimed the keanu was a miscast. His reasoning was we love Keanu because he is a wholesome guy. However, Johnny is an ??????? badass character. I disagree with this claim that Keanu was a miscast. seriously don't care how an actor is in real life compared to a character they ACT as. I have loved every interaction with Johnny and I love listening to the comments he makes towards your choices.Driving/Cars - Really sucks there is no car customization AT all. It got scrapped during development. I do sincerely hope they add it in a DLC down the road. However, the cars in this game just all look sick and unique. I don't think most of them feel ""out there"". Driving feels ""ok"" with MnK. I have used controller and it feels much better after tweaking with controller options. However, I don't think its as bad as the raging twitter/reddit people would want to tell you. It's ""fine"". Its perfect it could use slight tweaks.My biggest gripe with ""driving"" is how ZOOMED in the minimap is when driving. You are flying 100mph and then you gotta slam your brakes and make a sharp turn because there is no way you knew you had to take that exit. Then you end up drifting and killing 3 small children and you feel like ???? ;-;/Performance and Optimization - With my setup (specs below) I get around 60-90fps (unless I am in the dense and high population areas.) I run the game at mostly high settings and RTX on with DLSS-Q. This game needs some love on the optimization side. I don't know how much more CDPR can do to fix it but there has to be something. However, I do think we will just need to wait for more advances with hardware until we can get 100+ fps with RTX.RPG Elements Will update what I think of skills when I beat the game.Kinda sucks secondary stats have such little effect when all that really seems to matter is DPS. Would like more detail and work done to weapon stats. For example, why do the sights in this game have -0.05% reduced ADS speed. You wouldn't even notice that.Transmog systems people. Its 2020 and this SHOULD have been in the game at launch. I can't make my character not look ??????? stupid.Romance - Pretty ??????? big let down. You only get one person you can romance per gender and sexuality. For example as a Male V (straight) I can ONLY romance panam. There is no choice or anything... that is it. I have heard that the Male V (gay) option is downright horrible, but youll have to see for yourself or research.Not many choice with escorts (if you care). Very slight differences in each sex scene.Panam is waifu <3**NOTE**: There is a character you meet early game that you can have a ""moment"" with. Don't want to spoil it but you can look it up if you want.Bugs - Oh boy where to begin...- constant graphical bugs and light flickering during certain moments.- bug where when I enter the vehicle I am floating 5 ft above?- floating cars- cars flying 1000 ft in the air for no reason- characters t-posing- charcters just straight up twitching- Cars driving all over the place (cars will randomly ??????? swerve to the side of the lane or cross it and if you are on a bike good luck)- during ""cutscenes"" and riding with other characters in vehicles. The car will not feel like its on the ground and they never follow a consistent path. You will just feel like you are sliding on ice or just straight up teleporting.- Randomly switching from night to day or from raining to sunny.TLDR: Mostly visual bugs and immersion breakers. I have only crashed once and I think it was actually windows with how it happened. To the people that are crashing just update your drivers and make sure you are not overclocking as much. I had to turn down my gpu core clock when playing cyberpunk. Ran just fine with other games until CB2077.theres a ???? ton more but heres all I have time to type up.SPECS:RTX 3090 24GB OC'd9700k @ 5GHZ32GB 3200hz RAMSSD 2560x1440p 165z monitorWho would I recommend them this game too?

Doubt patches will have substantial impact on fps in the long runAs of November:Really sad to see that more content has been delayed. The game definitely would have benefited from another 1 to 2 years delay. Despite all the bugs and missing features that seem standard, there was still a lot to enjoy. The side quests, main story, and the dialogue is what I really enjoyed. I am a sucker for the cyberpunk genre. I still have yet to crash in this game or have any game breaking bugs.

this game so far theres no character i wish wasnt in the gamemain character  male v i never expected me to deeply care about v and how hes feeling i am more playing it like i am the character playing through a vessel if that makes any sense dont hate me but i just couldnt give a  about geralt for the first half of witcher  so this could be like that but i have to yet to care about v like characters from other games thats ok to me it hasnt taken the experience down for mejohnny silverhand  skillup claimed the keanu was a miscast his reasoning was we love keanu because he is a wholesome guy however johnny is an  badass character i disagree with this claim that keanu was a miscast seriously dont care how an actor is in real life compared to a character they act as i have loved every interaction with johnny and i love listening to the comments he makes towards your choicesdrivingcars  really sucks there is no car customization at all it got scrapped during development i do sincerely hope they add it in a dlc down the road however the cars in this game just all look sick and unique i dont think most of them feel out there driving feels ok with mnk i have used controller and it feels much better after tweaking with controller options however i dont think its as bad as the raging twitterreddit people would want to tell you its fine its perfect it could use slight tweaksmy biggest gripe with driving is how zoomed in the minimap is when driving you are flying mph and then you gotta slam your brakes and make a sharp turn because there is no way you knew you had to take that exit then you end up drifting and killing  small children and you feel like  performance and optimization  with my setup specs below i get around fps unless i am in the dense and high population areas i run the game at mostly high settings and rtx on with dlssq this game needs some love on the optimization side i dont know how much more cdpr can do to fix it but there has to be something however i do think we will just need to wait for more advances with hardware until we can get  fps with rtxrpg elements will update what i think of skills when i beat the gamekinda sucks secondary stats have such little effect when all that really seems to matter is dps would like more detail and work done to weapon stats for example why do the sights in this game have  reduced ads speed you wouldnt even notice thattransmog systems people its  and this should have been in the game at launch i cant make my character not look  stupidromance  pretty  big let down you only get one person you can romance per gender and sexuality for example as a male v straight i can only romance panam there is no choice or anything that is it i have heard that the male v gay option is downright horrible but youll have to see for yourself or researchnot many choice with escorts if you care very slight differences in each sex scenepanam is waifu note there is a character you meet early game that you can have a moment with dont want to spoil it but you can look it up if you wantbugs  oh boy where to begin constant graphical bugs and light flickering during certain moments bug where when i enter the vehicle i am floating  ft above floating cars cars flying  ft in the air for no reason characters tposing charcters just straight up twitching cars driving all over the place cars will randomly  swerve to the side of the lane or cross it and if you are on a bike good luck during cutscenes and riding with other characters in vehicles the car will not feel like its on the ground and they never follow a consistent path you will just feel like you are sliding on ice or just straight up teleporting randomly switching from night to day or from raining to sunnytldr mostly visual bugs and immersion breakers i have only crashed once and i think it was actually windows with how it happened to the people that are crashing just update your drivers and make sure you are not overclocking as much i had to turn down my gpu core clock when playing cyberpunk ran just fine with other games until cbtheres a  ton more but heres all i have time to type upspecsrtx  gb ocdk  ghzgb hz ramssd xp

despite all the bugs and missing features that seem standard there was still a lot to enjoy the side quests main story and the dialogue is what i really enjoyed i am a sucker for the cyberpunk genre i

"TL:DR: Even IF this game gets patched and fixed i don't know if i can recommend this game or creators. They lied to all the people that wanted this game to be good, so go with a company that actually doesn't spit in your face by continuing to lie to you the consumer.EDIT: Okay wow idk how CDPR is still doing fine with this game, i stopped playing for a while (As i said i would with my review) and have been seeing that there has been a few new patches. Well i thought to myself fine i'll start the game up and as i did i now cannot even get passed the LAUNCHER i now cannot start the game i will be redownloading it but everyone beware ANY game that these creators make in the future because i cannot wrap my mind around how badly made this game is.Gosh i hate to say this, but the game really is OK (At its current state). Game play is pretty good, graphics are good, i wouldn't say that they are ""next gen"" but they are good. The story is amazing, I haven't beat the game yet however the hours i put in were/are great. Now you're probably wondering why i am not recommending the game well it's because of the state the game is in they released the game poorly optimized with so many bugs i cannot play the game for 10 minutes without experiencing one. Most are not game breaking however i have had 2 that made me have to revert my save (Luckily the game is good on its auto saving) just wait a couple weeks or maybe months for the game to be patched out. Otherwise you'll be like me accidentally stumbling into a huge exploit in the game which has basically made me a god and really has just made me disappointed, once the game is patched out i will revise my review and restart the game i really don't want to become instantly OP in a so called RPG game that's really not the point of the game.On the other hand though the story is amazing i love it so much and is why i WILL revisit this game, i understand that a lot of people are upset about the brain dance situation (Only one scene that is highly scripted and was shown in the previews leading up to release) and yeah that makes me pretty frustrated that they would make it seem like brain dances were going to be the super crazy awesome game play feature to literally cut it out of the game almost completely. CDPR creators are great the higher ups are money hungry idiots that want to pretend the game is 2000% better then anything we have seen before while in actuality its full of bugs and really shouldn't have been released in the state it is in.

"Ok so I bought this game after looking at a lot of detailed reviews that highlighted a lot of points I will make, but it very much applies to my experience, I'm not regurgitating other's opinions.The game is buggy, poorly optimized, most of stuff promised isn't there... And yet I can't stop playing.Its universe is very convincing, the story is just awesome. Don't rush it, take your time building your reputation and the game will deliver back, what you do or don't do will have an impact later.I really hope they polish the game way more than it is right now, and I'm not even talking about bugs. Weapons are incredibly boring; you'll just pick whatever deals more damage and will change it within an hour with a new weapon you looted. Same with clothing, you won't be able to  have a good looking outfit without sacrificing crucial armor points, or spend hours farming for the money to buy a decent looking single piece of equipment that will last longer. Vehicles aren't customizable, but look good enough (in my opinion) to be worth the grind.The first pair of mantis arms (the blade forearms from the 2013 teaser) you'll buy will feel amazing, and every upgrade to the ripdoc (the surgeon implating your cyborg stuff) feels great to get. My only complain there is that I wish there was more diversity. For example, basic NPCs have extremely cool looking implants, such as chrome skin, cool looking arms and legs, golden elbows... but you can't get those. You can't change your appearance at all except for clothing, even piercings and tattoos are definitive once you finished customizing your character. Oh and it's all presets, you have like 20 different eyes to pick from, same with jaw etc. It's crucial that they at least allow us to change our character later in the game, and I think it's very saddening to see such a backward character creation tool. Even Oblivion allows more character customization.I would advise thinking about those points before buying the game. I still feel a little bit disappointed about the game, it's clearly not as revolutionary as they wanted us to think. It's not revolutionary at all in fact, it's just a regular open world, but the story - which I have not finished yet - and the side missions are really cool and I think it's a really good game overall. Just not what was originally advertised.Oh and also there is a Black Metal radio, pretty nice to include such a niche music genre.",ok so i bought this game after looking at a lot of detailed reviews that highlighted a lot of points i will make but it very much applies to my experience im not regurgitating others opinionsthe game is buggy poorly optimized most of stuff promised isnt there and yet i cant stop playingits universe is very convincing the story is just awesome dont rush it take your time building your reputation and the game will deliver back what you do or dont do will have an impact lateri really hope they polish the game way more than it is right now and im not even talking about bugs weapons are incredibly boring youll just pick whatever deals more damage and will change it within an hour with a new weapon you looted same with clothing you wont be able to  have a good looking outfit without sacrificing crucial armor points or spend hours farming for the money to buy a decent looking single piece of equipment that will last longer vehicles arent customizable but look good enough in my opinion to be worth the grindthe first pair of mantis arms the blade forearms from the  teaser youll buy will feel amazing and every upgrade to the ripdoc the surgeon implating your cyborg stuff feels great to get my only complain there is that i wish there was more diversity for example basic npcs have extremely cool looking implants such as chrome skin cool looking arms and legs golden elbows but you cant get those you cant change your appearance at all except for clothing even piercings and tattoos are definitive once you finished customizing your character oh and its all presets you have like  different eyes to pick from same with jaw etc its crucial that they at least allow us to change our character later in the game and i think its very saddening to see such a backward character creation tool even oblivion allows more character customizationi would advise thinking about those points before buying the game i still feel a little bit disappointed about the game its clearly not as revolutionary as they wanted us to think its not revolutionary at all in fact its just a regular open world but the story  which i have not finished yet  and the side missions are really cool and i think its a really good game overall just not what was originally advertisedoh and also there is a black metal radio pretty nice to include such a niche music genre,ok bought game looking lot detailed review highlighted lot point make much applies experience im regurgitating others opinionsthe game buggy poorly optimized stuff promised isnt yet cant stop playingits universe convincing story awesome dont rush take time building reputation game deliver back dont impact lateri really hope polish game way right im even talking bug weapon incredibly boring youll pick whatever deal damage change within hour new weapon looted clothing wont able good looking outfit without sacrificing crucial armor point spend hour farming money buy decent looking single piece equipment last longer vehicle arent customizable look good enough opinion worth grindthe first pair mantis arm blade forearm teaser youll buy feel amazing every upgrade ripdoc surgeon implating cyborg stuff feel great get complain wish diversity example basic npc extremely cool looking implant chrome skin cool looking arm leg golden elbow cant get cant change appearance except clothing even piercings tattoo definitive finished customizing character oh presets like different eye pick jaw etc crucial least allow u change character later game think saddening see backward character creation tool even oblivion allows character customizationi would advise thinking point buying game still feel little bit disappointed game clearly revolutionary wanted u think revolutionary fact regular open world story finished yet side mission really cool think really good game overall originally advertisedoh also black metal radio pretty nice include niche music genre,Positive

So far I've had an incredible time with this game. It's been amazing just to roam around Night City. I've experienced a few bugs here and there but nothing game breaking like some of friends have been especially on console they've been having serious problems. It's great so far and I would recommend giving it a play. It's most definitely a game made by CD Projekt Red. They put so much heart and soul into it just like they did with The Witcher 3. I can't wait to play it more and maybe eventually do everything there is to do in this game. I doubt I'll ever get around to it though because there's already tons of stuff to do and I'm not even 20 hours in yet.,so far ive had an incredible time with this game its been amazing just to roam around night city ive experienced a few bugs here and there but nothing game breaking like some of friends have been especially on console theyve been having serious problems its great so far and i would recommend giving it a play its most definitely a game made by cd projekt red they put so much heart and soul into it just like they did with the witcher  i cant wait to play it more and maybe eventually do everything there is to do in this game i doubt ill ever get around to it though because theres already tons of stuff to do and im not even  hours in yet,far ive incredible time game amazing roam around night city ive experienced bug nothing game breaking like friend especially console theyve serious problem great far would recommend giving play definitely game made cd projekt red put much heart soul like witcher cant wait play maybe eventually everything game doubt ill ever get around though there already ton stuff im even hour yet,Positive

"TLDR: Cyberpunk 2077 is a mixture of Watch Dog's hacking mechanics, Destiny's gunplay, Assassin's Creed's stealth, Red Dead 2's attention to environmental detail, and Dead Island's storytelling. It is a great game in an amazing environment, but characters feel hollow, mechanics feel wonky, and story is hard to follow. I enjoy the game, and would still recommend it, but recommend waiting a few weeks minimum.To preface, I love the game so far, but I went in with low expectations and have been fortunate enough not to experience any game/immersion breaking bugs that others have. If you're torn on whether or not to buy it, wait a few weeks. However, with that said there isn't much to be immersed in. The characters and world feel hollow, and your character feels like it's just been planted into the environment for no discernable reason. This is probably a byproduct of them trying to tell a big story without having it be as long as the Witcher 3 was because of complaints that it was too long. The first 5 hours feels like you're being railroaded through the main story, and it's just learning mechanics and fighting with wonky controls. There's a story going on but there isn't anything that makes you feel like you should be concerned or really involved with what's going on, so you just sit through the dialogue trees pressing the ones in yellow so you can get back out and explore the world.As other people have noted, the driving feels floaty, the roads feel too narrow, the turns are too sharp, and there's no way to limit how fast you're going other than just tapping W. So you're either going way to fast, or jolting along like a jalopy. If you can drive 5 yards without hitting something than you must be god himself.For shooting mechanics, the bullet sponginess is comparable to Destiny. An enemy the game told me was equal level to me managed to take 3 full magazines from an assault rifle to the head before he was able to land 5 hits to kill me (playing on normal difficulty). Besides the health bar, there's no indication that you're close to death other than an effect on the edges of the screen that you'll miss if you're firing a gun.You're railroaded through the first 5 hours of the game because you need to be either a higher level or have more money to do sidequests, and most of the time you won't find that out until you actually get up to the quest location. Because of this, you're just bombarded with story beats and character introductions. It got so bad that I didn't even realize I was playing the first major heist in the game.I do enjoy the level of detail that was put into the game. And hopefully the further into the story we get the better the pacing will be. It suffers from similar problems the Witcher 3 had, but that doesn't mean it's a bad game. I think CD projekt Red had an impossible amount of hype to live up to and while they did stumble a bit, overall the game is still worth that $60 price tag.  In reality, most of us have paid the same price or more for much less/or much worse.",tldr cyberpunk  is a mixture of watch dogs hacking mechanics destinys gunplay assassins creeds stealth red dead s attention to environmental detail and dead islands storytelling it is a great game in an amazing environment but characters feel hollow mechanics feel wonky and story is hard to follow i enjoy the game and would still recommend it but recommend waiting a few weeks minimumto preface i love the game so far but i went in with low expectations and have been fortunate enough not to experience any gameimmersion breaking bugs that others have if youre torn on whether or not to buy it wait a few weeks however with that said there isnt much to be immersed in the characters and world feel hollow and your character feels like its just been planted into the environment for no discernable reason this is probably a byproduct of them trying to tell a big story without having it be as long as the witcher  was because of complaints that it was too long the first  hours feels like youre being railroaded through the main story and its just learning mechanics and fighting with wonky controls theres a story going on but there isnt anything that makes you feel like you should be concerned or really involved with whats going on so you just sit through the dialogue trees pressing the ones in yellow so you can get back out and explore the worldas other people have noted the driving feels floaty the roads feel too narrow the turns are too sharp and theres no way to limit how fast youre going other than just tapping w so youre either going way to fast or jolting along like a jalopy if you can drive  yards without hitting something than you must be god himselffor shooting mechanics the bullet sponginess is comparable to destiny an enemy the game told me was equal level to me managed to take  full magazines from an assault rifle to the head before he was able to land  hits to kill me playing on normal difficulty besides the health bar theres no indication that youre close to death other than an effect on the edges of the screen that youll miss if youre firing a gunyoure railroaded through the first  hours of the game because you need to be either a higher level or have more money to do sidequests and most of the time you wont find that out until you actually get up to the quest location because of this youre just bombarded with story beats and character introductions it got so bad that i didnt even realize i was playing the first major heist in the gamei do enjoy the level of detail that was put into the game and hopefully the further into the story we get the better the pacing will be it suffers from similar problems the witcher  had but that doesnt mean its a bad game i think cd projekt red had an impossible amount of hype to live up to and while they did stumble a bit overall the game is still worth that  price tag  in reality most of us have paid the same price or more for much lessor much worse,tldr cyberpunk mixture watch dog hacking mechanic destiny gunplay assassin creed stealth red dead attention environmental detail dead island storytelling great game amazing environment character feel hollow mechanic feel wonky story hard follow enjoy game would still recommend recommend waiting week minimumto preface love game far went low expectation fortunate enough experience gameimmersion breaking bug others youre torn whether buy wait week however said isnt much immersed character world feel hollow character feel like planted environment discernable reason probably byproduct trying tell big story without long witcher complaint long first hour feel like youre railroaded main story learning mechanic fighting wonky control there story going isnt anything make feel like concerned really involved whats going sit dialogue tree pressing one yellow get back explore worldas people noted driving feel floaty road feel narrow turn sharp there way limit fast youre going tapping w youre either going way fast jolting along like jalopy drive yard without hitting something must god himselffor shooting mechanic bullet sponginess comparable destiny enemy game told equal level managed take full magazine assault rifle head able land hit kill playing normal difficulty besides health bar there indication youre close death effect edge screen youll miss youre firing gunyoure railroaded first hour game need either higher level money sidequests time wont find actually get quest location youre bombarded story beat character introduction got bad didnt even realize playing first major heist gamei enjoy level detail put game hopefully story get better pacing suffers similar problem witcher doesnt mean bad game think cd projekt red impossible amount hype live stumble bit overall game still worth price tag reality u paid price much lessor much worse,Positive

"This game is fantastic, like a beautiful mix of the modern Deus Ex games and Grant Theft Auto. The games world and quest design is fun and fairly enjoyable, the combat is solid as is the stealth, with the exception of some bugs I've mostly had fun.However, I simply can't recommend this game. The bugs and optimisation are one issue, which are entirely fixable in the future, or with having a beefier PC, however what's not as fixable is the almost non existent pacing, I got memories of games like Fable 3 where I felt like I was halfway through the main questline, when in fact I was facing the end. The amount of ending is also quite small, and it leaves little room for re-playability. I don't want to call the game bad, however it suffers from something many other Triple A Open world games suffer from just now, uninteresting but huge amounts of side content with worse writing than the main game, and ultimiately are only there for padding the game length and giving you a way to make money, which can only really be spent on buying upgrades to guns or your characters abilities, or cars. However a lot of this stuff isn't even necessary and you can completely play through without spending much at all. That is the reason I will not recommend this game right now, the bugs and glitches are one thing, but for a game in development for 8 years to have not only considerably less content than the Witcher 3, but also terrible pacing, and near to no actual End Game content it is not worth the price tag.

"I currently have a love-hate relationship with this game. Despite saying I don't recommend this game, I actually do find it very much enjoyable, and if you're just looking for an action cyberpunk game, then definitely get this. However, if you're looking for an in-depth rpg, maybe give this one some time. I do think this game has suffered from over-hype (like most AAA titles now), but at the same time I am a bit disappointed. This is the same company that made Witcher 3, so I know they are capable of doing better, and if the Witcher 3 is an indicator, they'll most likely patch most of the issues people have in some way.So what are my specific issues? First, I should preface this by saying I intentionally went out of my way to avoid any spoilers, teasers, and info about this game for the past few years. I wanted to avoid all the hype and promises as much as possible, because I knew that if I gave in to that bs, I would definitely be disappointed. Apart from some common (though minor) graphical issues, I actually haven't experienced any game-breaking bugs, and I don't have any major performance drops, despite only having the recommended specs. My biggest issue with this game is that is was marketed as this insanely in-depth rpg that was going to show up all the mediocre rpgs of the previous gens (such as Outer Worlds and Fallout 4), but so far it seems like character choices barely matter at all. This wouldn't be apparent to me if I wasn't also watching my spouse play this game, and having shockingly similar outcomes despite making very different characters. It feels like this game forces you into playing a certain way, the different dialogue options don't impact the story/quest in any major way, the character creator will leave you disappointed, and no matter what type of person you wanted to roleplay as, your character will sound like a nicotine-addicted edgelord regardless. Maybe for casual gamers all of this is fine, and the decent combat mechanics will be enough for you, but as someone who plays ACTUAL role-playing games, I don't see why this should be called an rpg. The most ""rpg"" aspect of it is the skill tree, which is a bit overwhelming yet underexciting at the same time.So, ignoring the disappointing rpg aspects....this game is actually pretty good. Not only is it beautiful as hell, but the world truly feels lived in. The worldbuilding is great, and I think CDPR did an excellent job at making it feel believable. I'm currently playing on hard, and as of right now the enemies feel like bullet sponges, but I'm not sure if that's true for other difficulties. The hacking mechanics, though a bit tedious and almost useless in large fights, are unique enough that I consider them a positive.CDPR, if you're reading this, I have two points of advice that would greatly improve the game....first, add more character body customization options (a sculpting tool similar to Sims 4 would be perfect), and give us more choices in the game that allow us to roleplay as a specific character in a meaningful way. A sandbox-type option would also be great, but I know that would be a lot of work...it's just, if you want to call this game an rpg, then you need account for those players who, for example, don't want their characters to be forced into a friendship with a guy we barely know. What if we don't want to play as V, a rugged mercenary that is going to ""burn the city to the ground"". This especially feels out of place with the corpo lifepath.",i currently have a lovehate relationship with this game despite saying i dont recommend this game i actually do find it very much enjoyable and if youre just looking for an action cyberpunk game then definitely get this however if youre looking for an indepth rpg maybe give this one some time i do think this game has suffered from

"150 hours in on my first playthrough. Yeah it is currently very buggy. T-Poses, falling thru the world, etc etc. I had one mission where as soon as I finished and got into my car, the game would crash and it was a repeatable thing. Some of the bosses just stood there and let me wail on them. Sometimes the audio would get louder or cut off. Suffice to say, there are a lot of bugs.It is still my number 1 favorite game of all time.Beneath all the problems, there is such a gem here. The relationships you make with the huge list of side characters actually feel genuine. The world that's built here is something you want to explore rather than feeling like a chore.I'm not really good with explaining things or reviewing things which is why I don't do it often. But this game planted me and for 150 hours so far, it had every bit of my attention. I truly love this game and am going to spend a lot of time in it. If you would rather wait til everything is ironed out, by all means do so. But I'd encourage you to try this game, at least once.

"All the media they shown for this game is VERY misleading. If you want a game to scratch that open-world itch, it won't be anything like Red Dead Redemption 2 in terms of interacting with the world. As far as I can tell, the world is huge, beautiful and brimming with ""life,"" that is npcs that don't have any interaction whatsoever. CDPR marketed that the scope of this game would be big, and ambitious- I have failed to see that.Despite this, I heavily enjoyed the game, namely the story. Although shorter than I would like, the story itself I find to be worth the price. I felt really connected with the characters, and was very interested in how they developed over the course of the game. Like in the Witcher 3, CDPR will give you that ""feeling"" once you beat the game.If you were interested in buying the game for the open world aspect, I would avoid buying this game. If you don't have a mid-range computer, wait for CDPR to actually optimize the game before buying. If you somehow have one of those 3080s that nobody can get and you love a good story, just click ""add to cart"".",all the media they shown for this game is very misleading if you want a game to scratch that openworld itch it wont be anything like red dead redemption  in terms of interacting with the world as far as i can tell the world is huge beautiful and brimming with life that is npcs that dont have any interaction whatsoever cdpr marketed that the scope of this game would be big and ambitious i have failed to see thatdespite this i heavily enjoyed the game namely the story although shorter than i would like the story itself i find to be worth the price i felt really connected with the characters and was very interested in how they developed over the course of the game like in the witcher  cdpr will give you that feeling once you beat the gameif you were interested in buying the game for the open world aspect i would avoid buying this game if you dont have a midrange computer wait for cdpr to actually optimize the game before buying if you somehow have one of those s that nobody can get and you love a good story just click add to cart,medium shown game misleading want game scratch openworld itch wont anything like red dead redemption term interacting world far tell world huge beautiful brimming life npc dont interaction whatsoever cdpr marketed scope game would big ambitious failed see thatdespite heavily enjoyed game namely story although shorter would like story find worth price felt really connected character interested developed course game like witcher cdpr give feeling beat gameif interested buying game open world aspect would avoid buying game dont midrange computer wait cdpr actually optimize game buying somehow one nobody get love good story click add cart,Positive

"Actually wanted to take the time to write a thorough review of the game so far.The GoodNight City is hands down the most detailed city to ever have existed in video game history. There is an insane amount to see and I'm easily getting lost in the vast sprawl. Exploration is not only encouraged, but I haven't come across a single invisible wall in the city yet. With the jumping/vaulting/climbing system, you can get to a LOT of crazy places, usually allowing you to tackle jobs/gigs/etc from many different angles.The combat is actually a lot of fun, imo, especially if you're a fan of something like Borderlands. Yes, the enemies are health sponges, but that can be overcome. My current setup has me using a sniper that deals ludicrous amounts of damage. It can shoot through literally any surface and wall. With a head shot, it will one-shot most enemies. Combined with hacking cameras and tagging enemies, I can hardly even be touched. The stealth is fine and isn't something I'd write home about at the moment, but I haven't really dipped any perk points into it. Perks are REALLY important in this game. Another thing, the guns sound, look, and feel fantastic.The story is 'slow', but the characters are incredibly real and I'm loving it so far. I'm not in a rush in this game at all, and I honestly don't think the game caters very well to people looking to rush through it. I'm also really enjoying the side quests and many of them have an insane amount of detail.One of the complaints I see a lot of people making is with the vehicles. With a controller, they are a lot easier to handle than with M+KB, and I think the handling is on par with GTA V vehicles. In certain situations, I'd argue they're better. The BadThere are... soooo many bugs. So. Many. Bugs.UI getting stuck, NPCs/cars appearing and disappearing, physics glitching, random collisions damaging and killing me, clothing spazzing, items appearing in the wrong tabs, vehicles spawning in wrong, guns not reloading, guns disappearing in your hands, slopes will occasionally send you flying, dialogue occasionally bugging out, my controller will randomly stop working, etc., etc., etc... Surprisingly, in 23 hours, I haven't had a single crash, but I know others have and some of my friends have too.Performance is honestly just 'okay'. I'm playing with a 2070 Super, Ryzen 3700x, 16gb RAM, on an SSD at 1440p. I keep RTX off, DLSS set to Quality, and everything else maxed. I usually get between 40-90fps, with occasional dips to MUCH lower frames. Just depends on the location. Also, driving quickly through the city can really kill my frames while the game loads assets in. Hoping this will be improved.There is no RP walk binding for keyboard. This HURTS ME. I like to RP in video games and this is seriously killing my immersion. It's also 2020 and we CAN'T rebind every single key binding in the game. This is absolute BS, imo, and is actually having a major impact on disabled players.ConclusionI think there is a 9 or 10/10 game here, potentially, but it isn't there yet. It needs a LOT more polish and bugs to be fixed before it I'd put it in my God-tier game list. Considering I haven't experienced a totally game-breaking bug so far, my current score would be an 8/10. I'm hoping with future patches that number will go up. But as of now, it kinda feels like I'm more of a play tester than an end-user. Nevertheless, what IS there right now easily meets my expectations and has surpassed them in many ways. I'm having an absolute blast playing the game right now.",actually wanted to take the time to write a thorough review of the game so farthe goodnight city is hands down the most detailed city to ever

"This game evoked emotions I haven't felt since before I became a man. What's that word they used before the ""new normal""? Oh yeah, Nostalgia. Millennials born after 1990 wouldn't have a clue. The time when dial-up was a thing and patience a virtue. When rap was life and death and pop was grunge depression. Huddling over the stolen Penthouse mag with your boyz and taking turns playing fighting games on console with the crew after school. I don't recall one game I've played in the past 5 years that can tap into your soul like this one (and you can see I've played a lot). Do yourself a favor and experience the raw and unbridled emotions of the 90's.

"It started out a little rough, as expected with such a project. The story and atmosphere was so enthralling however that I pushed through any technical issues that arose until I finished my first playthrough at around 100 hours. After finishing the game for the first time and choosing a less than perfect ending the hole in my gut was palpable so I went back before the ""are you sure"" final quest point and rectified things. Never have I been so compelled by a story in a FPS driven shooter.I've been meaning to really start a proper 2nd playthrough using a different build but I'm afraid I'll ignore the rest of my game library for another 100hrs while I go through it.

"For you who wanted to play the game and have minimum requirements, I advised you to at least wait for the another patch come out, especially about the stability and optimize for lower end graphics. Though, this game will be a hard to love for somebody who encounter many bugs, including me. However, this game is great and has lot of potential, but you just need to wait a little longer for them to fix the mess they did in this game. It will not comes real fast, but if you trust CDPR, you should be patient...So, here's the pros:+ The city itself. CDPR does really makes the city looks alive and make a unique feeling when exploring things. They did the job polishing the city so it become a real attraction for player to explore the Night City;+ Lot things to do from beginning through the end of game, especially the amount of side quests (the yellow and blue NCPD one);+ The world construct is top-notch from the inside-out;+ Has lot of elements that combined into one game;+ The Driving mode is not what I expected in a good way. Different vehicle has different feel. And the interior is just beautifully done in each cars;+ Lot of easter eggs and pop culture references;+ Lot of secrets to discover around the city;+ Cyberware mods;+ Lot of skill tree and perk to try for different playstyles;+ Offering different approach to completing quests.+ The main quests is the only thing very polished and giving a good feeling when completing. And there's few side quests that polished like main quests does. But they did hella main quests..And the cons:- Lifeless city. NPC gives nothing more except its just there;- Buggy as hell, and glitch everywhere you go. You'll encounter many and many bugs along your way in Night City and that very noticeable. Nothing gamebreaking, but annoy me like I have to restart the game in order fix the bug so the game work properly as intended;- For me, the game still not optimized for low end graphic card like mine. Got 20-30 fps on low setting and running on 1080p.So I recommend to switch to 768p and turn the static fidelity on, it'll boost the fps to around 40-60, but sometimes still down to 30fps when in combat.- The feeling like Watch Dogs when hacking gives unoriginal feeling, though you can personalized your hacking skill through cyberdeck mod that will gives you different needs in different situations.- Generic side quests. Though it has lot of side quests, you will feel that sometimes the quests is generic.- The female voice actor for V is sounds too edgy (at least for me, maybe the male too);- AI is just a ???????? and sometimes spawn outta nowhere, especially the police. AI scripting is pathetic that makes the world feels lifeless and they just have no routines that makes them interesting;- Driving mode sometimes feels on and off;- Wanted level is a meh;- The looting systems is another meh. Sometimes some loot can't be picked up. Just look at Borderlands 3 for reference and you see why;- The gunsplay is just not that worth it although it has 3 different types of guns (Power, Tech, Smart). Just compare it to Borderlands 3 (again) which is better. And the visual is too absurdly mixed to one and another during combat, especially when dark;- The gameplay just wants to be Jack-of-All-Trades that not too good in each playstyles. What a shame;- Glitchy UI. Sometimes there something stuck on screen and you cannot get rid of it unless you re-launch the game;- Sometimes animation is bugged. It's kinda easy to ignore except when it comes to facial expression when somebody talking to you, just annoying;- Though the side quests is abundant, the feeling is totally different from doing main quests. And the side quests is just there to get done real quick and not memorable.",for you who wanted to play the game and have minimum requirements i advised you to at least wait for the another patch come

"Seriously enjoying the game, and don't know why everyone is giving it a bad rep. Sure it might not have all the QOL aspects for an open world city like GTA, but still has lots of great content and tons of stuff to do. Combat/stealth mechanics are fun, body mods and hacking add a flavour to the game. The city itself is beautiful and I love exploring it!Lets give CDPR a chance to fix the bugs (which aren't game breaking) and hopefully they will release new patches/DLC with bug fixes and more content for us to enjoy, rather than everyone giving them hell and forcing them to give up on the game.

"It looks pretty cool, but after playing for a bit this 'open world' RPG shows itself to be completely shallow and possibly unfinished. It promises quite a bit to start with, and had me coming back night after night to explore more of the city. But it soon became pretty boring, and way too easy - I wanted to play the part of a stealthy hacker, taking my time to creep around and silently slay my foes, and some of the quests (Main and Side) definitely cater for this, in some cases making it almost a necessity. However, when you can single headshot your foes with a pistol and have them all looted in under a minute it becomes a bit pointless and samey. It takes the challenge and 'role play' aspect out of it, all but rendering exploration too boring and a waste of time. Other aspects of the game feel rushed or unfinished, with many simple QoL details non existent, where with a bit more time and polish their inclusion could have added so much more to the game - things like more dialogue for the NPCs that wander the streets. More variation with consumables and their affects. Better nightlife entertainment options. More romancible characters. Better cars with storage and customisation options. Less pointless perks. Equipment with stat bonuses that actually do something. Difficulty balancing. A better apartment with more storage options (and upgradable). The list goes on...(actually thats all I can think of at the moment)A little admission from me...I've barely touched the main story line, and that may well be pretty good fun. But I bought into an open world RPG, and when I got out there and explored, I didn't really find anything exciting, and was left pretty disappointed with Cyberpunk....Will come back in maybe a year and hope some of those changes I mentioned have been added and filled the large open world gap that's outside the main story.

"I'm enjoying the game but I can't give it a good review, at least not yet. The game is obviously full of bugs and crashes quite often.The AI is practically non-existent, vehicles disappear if you don't look at them for a second and the police system is not challenging at all.

"TLDR: As of 12/25/20, I give this 8/10 IF you have a rig that can play the game at decent settings. If you don't, stay away and wait for more patches.Specs for reference: 3900x, 2080TI, 32 gigs ram, getting dips to high 30 ranges on RTX ultra, stays around 40-50 in most areas.The Bad:- Getting the obvious out of the way first, is this what CDPR promised they would deliver with a massive open world with lots of choices that matter in the long run, NO. There are choices and side missions that matter, the endings change depending on which side missions you have completed, but there aren't that many variations. If they weren't coming off of Witcher 3 as the standard and hadn't made big promises, I wouldn't care. But they did.- The crashes and low performance, they needed a lot more time to optimize this. Low/unoptimized performance in a completely new AAA title I can understand, crashes is a bridge too far. I will say though that once I turned off my PBO/Manual OC and with 1.05, I had absolutely zero crashes no matter what I did.- The AI sucks. Pedestrians do random things that make no sense, cops appear out of nowhere and then proceed to not even be competent at their jobs, traffic AI seems to be non-existent beyond the basic move from point A to point B. In hindsight though, for the actual story/side/gig missions none of this matters, which is an additional con on its own.- The world needs a lot more life. Night City is beautiful, one of the most immersive environments I have ever seen in a game. But at the same time, I can see all these beautiful buildings and signs and shops but can't just walk up to them and see what's happening inside. Don't conflate this with a lack of side missions/gigs, there's 100s of them scattered around the map. It's just a shame that so much of the map feels filled and empty at the same time.- The parts that were cut away. I know there will be DLC that fills in more of the story, that's just a reality of today's world. But the intro sections for the 3 life-paths need to be added in without any additional charge. Those were promised in the trailers/demos, they're supposedly 10-20 hrs of contents per life-path on their own and the story choices just feel a bit lacking without them.- Dialogue choices sometimes feel like obvious options are missing. They also don't connect, why does the required dialogue choices need to vary with how many of the optional dialogue options were used for example.- Romance/Side character options. This is very frustrating because I did all the side missions that influence the main story and the characters are some of the most interesting I have seen in a AAA game in a long time. But you just don't have much interaction with them outside of missions. I think we're spoiled by GTA here but if I go to the trouble of finishing all the missions for one of them, I would like to hang out with them for random things as well to explore the city and more of their life in it.- Gigs/side missions can be a bit lacking in terms of variation. A lot of them are go from A to B, or steal something etc.The Good:- Night City is just plain breathtaking. After trying different settings, decided this is just too good looking a game to adjust for performance. Probably the first game ever I have done that for. RTX Ultra throughout the game despite dips to high 30fps on a 2080Ti. No regrets. I will go back to the game just to drive around and see the city even if I don't do any missions.- RPG elements are great, think of this as a mix of Deus Ex and Witcher 3.- Replay value is very high, many different options, lots of side missions/gigs on the map to keep you occupied even through multiple re-runs.- The story, this is subjective and I wasn't entirely happy with the ending options. But it's still one of the most compelling sci-fi stories I have seen and it was enough to keep me glued to the game to get to the ending. The world setting is amazing, there is lots of reading material to add to the world building for people who like that sort of detail, I can keep going for hours on the interesting interactions I have had while playing this game. Just the sheer number of different types of humans and AI you'll meet throughout the game alone is amazing.- The secondary names characters are awesome, I spent a very long time making sure I could finish every side mission related to the important ones and going through all the dialogue options. I would replay the game just to see what happens with different choices and to figure out if there's more of their storylines that I missed in the first playthrough.- I can point out a lot of small details that CDPR definitely got right, the scattered graffiti around the city, the less important side characters with their nuances, a world that feels lived in and alive (but read the corresponding con). Basically, this feels like a world I want to visit and spend time in and explore. And that's a very hard thing to create in any game.Even with the missing elements, once this thing stopped crashing, it is one of the best games I have played this year. It just leaves me wanting for a lot more. Can CDPR fix the AI issues and bring some more life to Night City like I mentioned in the cons? Maybe add back the cut out intro content to extend the story a few more hours? CDPR needs to spend a significant amount of time still polishing this gem. But I have no doubt that once they're done, this will be a defining masterpiece for this generation.",tldr as of  i give this  if you have a rig that can play the game at decent settings if you dont

"IntroductionBeware, this review contains spoilersI want to immediately apologize to anyone who thinks this doesn't deserve a negative review.?? You may be right, but this is my opinion, I will leave comments open, share your opinion, if you have something to say.RewiewAs said Alt: ""V will die independent of what i do. This is inevitable. This is imminent.""At this moment, I understand that with such energy and strength she simply can't be wrong and ,therefore, I believe her.To be honest, the game mocked me, especially at the end, constantly putting me in a hopeless position.Now I understand why they removed the word rpg from the description of the game - the main character dies, which means you. The developers wanted to show a dark future and they did it brilliantly, but they went too far, getting used to the role of the main character, you empathize with him, you want to help in every way, and they anyway killing you.And then they offer to roll back and ""complete a couple more tasks"" - and for what, if I know that I will die anyway, now or later - it doesn't matter, result is same.But to all this, they added oil on fire - romance. I liked Judy, I began to empathize with her then, when Evelyn Parker committed suicide, leaving Judy alone... When she described and showed her past, I realized for myself that I wouldn't leave her ever alone anymore.Sure, you can feed yourself theories that Panam's people, she talked about at the end will help us, but let's face it: if Arasaka can't do that, then how will the rednecks help us?I didn't like the endings of this game, they do not inspire the desire to ""live in this game"". Previously, after work, I could go into the GTA and engage in various activities, both online and offline. I don't want to play this game anymore, I drive around the city in a car and understand,that i will die soon. That's the first reason why i don't want to do any activities on the map.There is hope that V is alive. In my ending, Judy prepares breakfast, Victor asks: ""when you will come to see me,we haven't seen for a long time each other"", Rogue suggests us don't lose her contacts, but call if we need a work, Misty saw an ambiguous future on the cards and.....they all are united by one thing - nobody else is worried about our health anymore. Therefore, the developers are obliged to release dlc, in which we will be given the opportunity to return to night-city ""for a couple of days"", otherwise I will hate this game with all my heart until the end of my life, and ofc I will hate the CDPR that caused me moral harm.??????",introductionbeware this review contains spoilersi want to immediately apologize to anyone who thinks this doesnt deserve a negative review you may be right but this is my opinion i will leave comments open share your opinion if you have something to sayrewiewas said alt v will die independent of what i do this is inevitable this is imminentat this moment i understand that with such energy and strength she simply cant be wrong and therefore i believe herto be honest the game mocked me especially at the end constantly putting me in a hopeless positionnow i understand why they removed the word rpg from the description of the game  the main character dies which means you the developers wanted to show a dark future and they did it brilliantly but they went too far getting used to the role of the main character you empathize with him you want to help in every way and they anyway killing youand then they offer to roll back and complete a couple more tasks  and for what if i know that i will die anyway now or later  it doesnt matter result is samebut to all this they added oil on fire  romance i liked judy i began to empathize with her then when evelyn parker committed suicide leaving judy alone when she described and showed her past i realized for myself that i wouldnt leave her ever alone anymoresure you can feed yourself theories that panams people she talked about at the end will help us but lets face it if arasaka cant do that then how will the rednecks help usi didnt like the endings of this game they do not inspire the desire to live in this game previously after work i could go into the gta and engage in various activities both online and offline i dont want to play this game anymore i drive around the city in a car and understandthat i will die soon thats the first reason why i dont want to do any activities on the mapthere is hope that v is alive in my ending judy prepares breakfast victor asks when you will come to see mewe havent seen for a long time each other rogue suggests us dont lose her contacts but call if we need a work misty saw an ambiguous future on the cards andthey all are united by one thing  nobody else is worried about our health anymore therefore the developers are obliged to release dlc in which we will be given the opportunity to return to nightcity for a couple of days otherwise i will hate this game with all my heart until the end of my life and ofc i will hate the cdpr that caused me moral harm,introductionbeware review contains spoilersi want immediately apologize anyone think doesnt deserve negative review may right opinion leave comment open share opinion something sayrewiewas said alt v die independent inevitable imminentat moment understand energy strength simply cant wrong therefore believe herto honest game mocked especially end constantly putting hopeless positionnow understand removed word rpg description game main character dy mean developer wanted show dark future brilliantly went far getting used role main character empathize want help every way anyway killing youand offer roll back complete couple task know die anyway later doesnt matter result samebut added oil fire romance liked judy began empathize evelyn parker committed suicide leaving judy alone described showed past realized wouldnt leave ever alone anymoresure feed theory panams people talked end help u let face arasaka cant redneck help usi didnt like ending game inspire desire live game previously work could go gta engage various activity online offline dont want play game anymore drive around city car understandthat die soon thats first reason dont want activity mapthere hope v alive ending judy prepares breakfast victor asks come see mewe havent seen long time rogue suggests u dont lose contact call need work misty saw ambiguous future card andthey united one thing nobody else worried health anymore therefore developer obliged release dlc given opportunity return nightcity couple day otherwise hate game heart end life ofc hate cdpr caused moral harm,Negative

"I mean this is kind of obvious if you checked any review on this game online. But let's just say it is not the experience you were shown in the videos by the publisher. And it is a shame...This game runs very bad on the recommended (not the minimal) system requirements. You will get around 30fps on medium/low settings making the game look terrible. You will also experience framedrops in gunfights which makes the game feel terrible.The lack of optimisation also made my gpu run red hot at 100% at all times. Overheating the system.Apart from that the game is full of gamebreaking bugs, sometimes you fall through the ground, sometimes you get stuck in a fence and can't get out anymore.There are also other bugs but they are not as gamebreaking, like mobs and NPC's locked in a T-pose, police spawning literally on top of you when you shoot a citizen, and many more bugs and glitches.",i mean this is kind of obvious if you checked any review on this game online but lets just say it is not the experience you were shown in the videos by the publisher and it is a shamethis game runs very bad on the recommended not the minimal system requirements you will get around fps on mediumlow settings making the game look terrible you will also experience framedrops in gunfights which makes the game feel terriblethe lack of optimisation also made my gpu run red hot at  at all times overheating the systemapart from that the game is full of gamebreaking bugs sometimes you fall through the ground sometimes you get stuck in a fence and cant get out anymorethere are also other bugs but they are not as gamebreaking like mobs and npcs locked in a tpose police spawning literally on top of you when you shoot a citizen and many more bugs and glitches,mean kind obvious checked review game online let say experience shown video publisher shamethis game run bad recommended minimal system requirement get around fps mediumlow setting making game look terrible also experience framedrops gunfight make game feel terriblethe lack optimisation also made gpu run red hot time overheating systemapart game full gamebreaking bug sometimes fall ground sometimes get stuck fence cant get anymorethere also bug gamebreaking like mob npc locked tpose police spawning literally top shoot citizen many bug glitch,Negative

"*NOTE* This is a review of what I have experienced only.Overall the game is fun, the movement in combat is smooth. I would recommend getting the double jump cyberware and perks that allow you to shoot and reload while moving. The pace then feels amazing.Very few Main Quest missions and after doing several amazing sidequests you really stop caring about the main plot.I have only encountered a few game breaking bugs but still I would recommend quicksaving as often as you can. Visual bugs are all over the place but if you have played Skyrim or Witcher at launch it would just be funny or slightly annoying and not too bothersome. This is not Fallout New Vegas! Very important if you expect really immersive and a complete RPG where you create you own story it is not it. Visually the game is amazing but if you want to play it on 4k you will have to buy the newest Graphics Cards.Overall a solid 8/10.",note this is a review of what i have experienced onlyoverall the game is fun the movement in combat is smooth i would recommend getting the double jump cyberware and perks that allow you to shoot and reload while moving the pace then feels amazingvery few main quest missions and after doing several amazing sidequests you really stop caring about the main ploti have only encountered a few game breaking bugs but still i would recommend quicksaving as often as you can visual bugs are all over the place but if you have played skyrim or witcher at launch it would just be funny or slightly annoying and not too bothersome this is not fallout new vegas very important if you expect really immersive and a complete rpg where you create you own story it is not it visually the game is amazing but if you want to play it on k you will have to buy the newest graphics cardsoverall a solid,note review experienced onlyoverall game fun movement combat smooth would recommend getting double jump cyberware perk allow shoot reload moving pace feel amazingvery main quest mission several amazing sidequests really stop caring main ploti encountered game breaking bug still would recommend quicksaving often visual bug place played skyrim witcher launch would funny slightly annoying bothersome fallout new vega important expect really immersive complete rpg create story visually game amazing want play k buy newest graphic cardsoverall solid,Positive

The Long: Top to bottom the game is plagued with bugs and glitches, ranging anywhere from clipping (oh god the clipping) to entire characters/scenes not rendering in. Pop in is a consistent issue and more often than not characters/ npcs wont render properly and look like claymation figures. Bugs I can handle however, I am an avid Elder Scrolls/ Fallout player and experienced every horror that Kingdom Come had to offer and still enjoyed myself. No, where this game fails for me is the AI. To call it basic would be giving it far too much credit. For reference I am playing on Hard Difficulty so I expected some semblance of a well thought out AI. Credit where credits due, you do go down rather quickly especially on the harder difficulties and at first it feels like you really have to play cautiously with the AI, that is until the first stealth mission at the hotel. The AI is super easy to avoid in stealth but thats not really my issue here. Its about this time in the game that the stealth mechanic glitched out on me, and I got detected through a wall, ok yeah sure, so instead of reloading i just let the enemies kill me because im lazy. Well this particular npc that discovered my was a shotgunner, oh joy, quick death right? No. I stood still for a little over half a minute as a man with a shotgun attempted to kill me and I could visibly see the jank. He was close enough to me to warrant a melee attack but i guess realized he had a shotgun and would back up shoot once then retry a melee attack. Repeat until death. This wasnt the only instance of AI jank either, and its a rather consistent issue especially when they try and interact with cover. Overall I feel as though this game was pushed out for the Christmas release window and it will remain in an unfinished state for about another 4-6 months.

"A ton has been put out there about this game, but I have had a ton of fun with it so far. There are still some issues, I've experienced 2 crashes, and a number of glitchy things. But none of those were game breaking. The autosaves that occur in the background have saved me from the crashes, and also work decently when you die during gameplay. I'd certainly recommend this game to anyone who enjoys an open-world Storytelling game.",a ton has been put out there about this game but i have had a ton of fun with it so far there are still some issues ive experienced  crashes and a number of glitchy things but none of those were game breaking the autosaves that occur in the background have saved me from the crashes and also work decently when you die during gameplay id certainly recommend this game to anyone who enjoys an openworld storytelling game,ton put game ton fun far still issue ive experienced crash number glitchy thing none game breaking autosaves occur background saved crash also work decently die gameplay id certainly recommend game anyone enjoys openworld storytelling game,Positive
"A good game that needs more time to develop. TL;DR: I enjoyed the game but not worth the full price in its current state. Highly recommend waiting a few more months until devs fix technical problems and adds more content. Only get the game if you still support CD Projekt and futuristic setting.  Story:I mainly bought cyberpunk for the story. I did not watch any of the latest trailers, so my expectations were realistically low. Honestly, the story did not click until the second act. The first act for most people will be a hit or miss. Something about the characters and context within that section did not help me connect with the universe. I was on the verge of refunding the game but something in the second act that stops me from doing it.In the second act, the game is fully open. I was fully immersed within the universe because of the open content. There were tons of moments that I enjoyed. However, these moments in the main story came to end quickly. Unlike the Witcher 3, the quantity of the main story is very short. The main mission took me 3-4 days to reach the final mission with the side missions. In the Witcher 3, it took me at least a month to reach the climax. I am disappointed with the quantity of the missions as soon as the story starts to get even better. I was even taking my time to fully immerse myself.  However, the quality in the second act satisfied me.  If you are playing the game and doing the main missions, then you are playing it the wrong way.The true experience is the side quests. These are the missions is where you will clock in hours of gameplay. The side missions are premium tier and they are actually better than the main quests. There are so many side missions that they are literally around each corner of the map (excluding the trivial police missions). These side missions are not trivial where you do this and get your money. There are side missions like that. However, there are side missions that will flesh out characters along the way and even Night City. I have not finished one district and there just so many all over the place. I am happy to say that this is where the game shines the most. After doing these side missions, I realized that the story is Night City itself in which you find these in the side missions.Gameplay:I do not expect the gameplay to be amazing or revolutionary. I just want the game to be simply fun like a Metal Gear Solid game. The gameplay is pretty much like a looter shooter (Borderlands, Destiny etc). I do not like those types of games, but it will vary depending on your taste.  I find it to be decent to get around. Gunplay is probably the best part of the combat system. Reviewers are right in that aspect. Every weapon feels unique in its own way. I do not recall any weapons that feel like each other. There different types of revolvers and each revolver feels different. This is CD Projekt first time creating a shooters game, so they did an excellent job in that department.As for the RPG, I feel like it is a bit limiting. Of course, I do not expect to have everything in the game but some areas need improvement. There is no customization for a game that advertises “appearance is everything”. You cannot customize your character after the initial create your character (In Witcher you can change your hair at barbershops). You cannot customize your vehicle, your guns, or even have a safe house (besides the initial apartment). As for general appearance with clothing, there is no transfusion of armor, so if you want to have better armor, you must look like a goblin who has been living in a swamp for 50 years. This area is where I am mostly mad about because in the earlier trailers, the developers made it a big deal. Dialogue is pretty much straightforward just as in the Witcher.There is driving in the game. However, it feels like you are ice skating on them. Another problem with driving is that the map will indicate that you will need to take a sharp turn, but you will be driving so fast that you can’t stop in time. There are no hand brakes to address this. The overall driving is awkward but from my personal experience I got used to it.When putting everything together in the gameplay sections, it definitely improves from the Witcher despite the limitations. It plays well when you want to sit back and have a good time. I said earlier that I did not like looter shooters, but this is an RPG with looter shooters mechanics. In the end, it met my expectation, but it took a while to get used to it.  Problems/Bugs:People always complain about the bugs, but this game is way more complicated. It is not the bugs but the lack of cut content and the programming behind Cyberpunk. The A.I is very basic and does not feel lively. The police mechanic is a complete joke. If you play stealth, you are pretty much playing on easy difficulty. Even the A.I from Metal Gear Solid 1 is way more advance. Also, it feels like I was playing a full price early access. These problems won’t be solved by a simple patch. I feel like we will be getting more content through free updates, but we do not know when. I understand why they had to be cut out, but as a consumer, I want my money to be worth it especially full price. With the lack of content besides the side missions, the shallowness of Night City shows. Once the devs finally put out what they wanted, I will for sure go back for a second playthrough.This needs its own paragraph. My tolerance for bugs is high. However, this game tested my tolerance. I managed to played them off and for the most part, they are not as bad (As of Patch 1.06). There will be character models that are stuck in a T-pose or a piece of asset sticking out in “cutscenes”. The most game-breaking bug I had was cars just flying all over the place or cops spawning on top of me. I did not experience any crashes but I had some problems trying to launch my game. CD Projekt knows about these bugs and will fix them. The question is will they learn from their mistakes moving forward.Conclusion:If you took the time to read this review thank you so much. I want to like this game because of the goodwill established and my love for the Witcher franchise. Initially, I was on the verge of a refund but something about the game keeps pulling me back. However, I keep remembering the cut content due to the lack of customizations. The bugs need to be iron out more even with the latest patch. There is so much to talk about without having to write an already long review. You can tell that the developers put their passion out, but the upper management worked them like a sweatshop factory. I would be honestly fine if the game releases in 2022. I never spent $60 for a new game (Only spend 2 in my entire lifespan). When I spend $60, I know that the game will be worth it. After spending full price on Cyberpunk, this is one of the worst $60 I have ever spent.Despite my negativity, this game is great when it wants to be great. It's just that it feels like early access due to the basic A.I and cut content. All I want for Cyberpunk is to be at least be on par with the Witcher 3. It does not have to surpass it at all since it is a new IP. After playing Cyberpunk, the goodwill and the trust for CD Projekt Red is gone.  I no longer want to get their games within a one-year time frame. I am not optimistic with the Witcher 4 unless they figure out how to gain that trust again. They were my second most favorite company, but they have fallen so much due to corporate greed.This pains me by giving this game a thumbs up despite the RPG limitations, but it meets my realistic expectations. I bought this game because it was my winter break. If you have the patience of waiting for Cyberpunk for 3-4 months or even a year from now, I will highly recommend doing so. I wish I were one of the people who will wait.",a good game that needs more time to develop tldr i enjoyed the game but not worth the full price in its current state highly recommend waiting a few

"Really sick game that needs a LOT of work. Amazing world, solid gameplay, solid sountrack, solid story, and lots of cool cyberpunky things. Unfortunately as you may already know, this game is both a very buggy mess and a pot filled with a few half-baked mechanics and open world aspects (especially AI) that really need improvement. The game will absolutely be worth playing once it's fixed and finished. But, As of writing this review (Dec. 2020) I suggest you hold off on buying cyberpunk for quite a while. Once it has been fully fixed up and I finally play it again myself I will update this review. For now though, it's a thumbs down from me.",really sick game that needs a lot of work amazing world solid gameplay solid sountrack solid story and lots of cool cyberpunky things unfortunately as you may already know this game is both a very buggy mess and a pot filled with a few halfbaked mechanics and open world aspects especially ai that really need improvement the game will absolutely be worth playing once its fixed and finished but as of writing this review dec  i suggest you hold off on buying cyberpunk for quite a while once it has been fully fixed up and i finally play it again myself i will update this review for now though its a thumbs down from me,really sick game need lot work amazing world solid gameplay solid sountrack solid story lot cool cyberpunky thing unfortunately may already know game buggy mess pot filled halfbaked mechanic open world aspect especially ai really need improvement game absolutely worth playing fixed finished writing review dec suggest hold buying cyberpunk quite fully fixed finally play update review though thumb,Positive
"The game isn't bad, It's just mediocre. Like if I could give it a middling score I would but, even fixing the bugs won’t save some parts of the game.The good stuff is the story, the overall setting and Voice acting. I won’t get too into story stuff, but it has some solid beats in there. Night City is a cool setting for a game. The voice over stuff is well performed and for the most part delivery feels good and natural. Most every thing else in the game is either ok or bad. The gunplay is fine, some weapons feel better then others, but there is nothing here to get over excited about. The choices in the story are bare minimum at best, and If that’s your thing there are definitely better options out there. Driving is passable, mostly. The stuff that feels bad, feels very bad once you notice it. There seems to be 0 AI in the open world beyond “be here, walk there”. NPC’s don’t react much, and there is no real chase AI to speak of either. This and most of the things in the world just being pre-marked on the map lead to the game world feeling less like a living world, and more like big for the sake of being big. Like there doesn’t feel like a real reason to just poke your nose places. Even a special weapon that should be a reward for players going back somewhere is eventually just led to via a mission. To sum it up: The story is good and most things related to it and the side quests are pretty good, but everything else makes it hard for me to recommend.",the game isnt bad its just mediocre like if i could give it a middling score i would but even fixing the bugs won’t save some parts of the gamethe good stuff is the story the overall setting and voice acting i won’t get too into story stuff but it has some solid beats in there night city is a cool setting for a game the voice over stuff is well performed and for the most part delivery feels good and natural most every thing else in the game is either ok or bad the gunplay is fine some weapons feel better then others but there is nothing here to get over excited about the choices in the story are bare minimum at best and if that’s your thing there are definitely better options out there driving is passable mostly the stuff that feels bad feels very bad once you notice it there seems to be  ai in the open world beyond “be here walk there” npc’s don’t react much and there is no real chase ai to speak of either this and most of the things in the world just being premarked on the map lead to the game world feeling less like a living world and more like big for the sake of being big like there doesn’t feel like a real reason to just poke your nose places even a special weapon that should be a reward for players going back somewhere is eventually just led to via a mission to sum it up the story is good and most things related to it and the side quests are pretty good but everything else makes it hard for me to recommend,game isnt bad mediocre like could give middling score would even fixing bug ’ save part gamethe good stuff story overall setting voice acting ’ get story stuff solid beat night city cool setting game voice stuff well performed part delivery feel good natural every thing else game either ok bad gunplay fine weapon feel better others nothing get excited choice story bare minimum best ’ thing definitely better option driving passable mostly stuff feel bad feel bad notice seems ai open world beyond “ walk ” npc ’ ’ react much real chase ai speak either thing world premarked map lead game world feeling le like living world like big sake big like ’ feel like real reason poke nose place even special weapon reward player going back somewhere eventually led via mission sum story good thing related side quest pretty good everything else make hard recommend,Positive
"This game is terrible, like seriously if you're asking yourself if you should buy this game when it got taken off the PS store and handed out free refunds then I think your answer is crystal clear. aside from all the bugs, glitches and terrible optimization there is so much cut content they promised so much in the game and yet half of it wasn't in the final release. Might I mention the story it is so bland, the characters were poorly written and it ripped off so many other stories. It's not even immersive  this entire game sounds like it was filmed in a studio booth and the dialouge is so corny. The combat system was apparently supposed to make me ""feel the power"" but the only think I'm feeling is my PC heating up like a kitchen stove in any case the combat system is wack it   The driving physics were god awful too it felt like I was driving the Batmobile because I don't think anyone in CDPR knows how physics works. Also the AI in this game were trash they were more suicidal than the workers over at CD Projekt Red. Unless you have a high end killer PC like I do don't bother running this game because the gameplay will look like you're watching a slideshow. Therefore I don't recommend this to any players because people were just blinded by Keanu Reeves and hyped this game up like it was going to revolutionize mankind. If you want my advice I suggest you spend your $60 on a bottle of whiskey so you're not bothered by this games existence.",this game is terrible like seriously if youre asking yourself if you should buy this game when it got taken off the ps store and handed out free refunds then i think your answer is crystal clear aside from all the bugs glitches and terrible optimization there is so much cut content they promised so much in the game and yet half of it wasnt in the final release might i mention the story it is so bland the characters were poorly written and it ripped off so many other stories its not even immersive  this entire game sounds like it was filmed in a studio booth and the dialouge is so corny the combat system was apparently supposed to make me feel the power but the only think im feeling is my pc heating up like a kitchen stove in any case the combat system is wack it   the driving physics were god awful too it felt like i was driving the batmobile because i dont think anyone in cdpr knows how physics works also the ai in this game were trash they were more suicidal than the workers over at cd projekt red unless you have a high end killer pc like i do dont bother running this game because the gameplay will look like youre watching a slideshow therefore i dont recommend this to any players because people were just blinded by keanu reeves and hyped this game up like it was going to revolutionize mankind if you want my advice i suggest you spend your  on a bottle of whiskey so youre not bothered by this games existence,game terrible like seriously youre asking buy game got taken p store handed free refund think answer crystal clear aside bug glitch terrible optimization much cut content promised much game yet half wasnt final release might mention story bland character poorly written ripped many story even immersive entire game sound like filmed studio booth dialouge corny combat system apparently supposed make feel power think im feeling pc heating like kitchen stove case combat system wack driving physic god awful felt like driving batmobile dont think anyone cdpr know physic work also ai game trash suicidal worker cd projekt red unless high end killer pc like dont bother running game gameplay look like youre watching slideshow therefore dont recommend player people blinded keanu reef hyped game like going revolutionize mankind want advice suggest spend bottle whiskey youre bothered game existence,Positive
"Total gameplay was only about 24 hours half of which were side quests. Had lunch and dinner without closing.I just don't get why people still like this scam game. Game launch was delayed for almost a year, all the bugs even after all the delays, and almost all the promises that was made by the developer were not kept. Pretty much no freedom that affects the gameplay except the for the choice at the end for the ending, which is just a common aspect of open world game. If I've known, I would not purchase this game unless the developer fix all the bugs and run at the very least 70% discount.",total gameplay was only about  hours half of which were side quests had lunch and dinner without closingi just dont get why people still like this scam game game launch was delayed for almost a year all the bugs even after all the delays and almost all the promises that was made by the developer were not kept pretty much no freedom that affects the gameplay except the for the choice at the end for the ending which is just a common aspect of open world game if ive known i would not purchase this game unless the developer fix all the bugs and run at the very least  discount,total gameplay hour half side quest lunch dinner without closingi dont get people still like scam game game launch delayed almost year bug even delay almost promise made developer kept pretty much freedom affect gameplay except choice end ending common aspect open world game ive known would purchase game unless developer fix bug run least discount,Negative
"Can't recommend this game at this time for this price.  Some spoilers.  A lot of this are things I wish they would fix. I've really tried to give this game a good shot before this review.  At this point I've got some major bugs that I just can't stand anymore:1. This bug isn't as major, just can't complete the Delamain quest.  When he calls you when you enter an area with a vehicle, it just shows the ringing picture, then cuts off.  He never actually talks to me.  Found out loading games that it's a result of dying.  Loading a game before I died doesn't help though (change to the game files?) unless I load to before I leave the headquarters.  Can't say I'll never die ever before finishing all the quests...2. This is one that is very annoying.  Randomly driving down a street Johnny made a comment and now that comment is stuck on the screen.  I tried loading an old game to avoid that street, but he just said it in a different location.  Every time I load a game, his voice repeats the statement and the closed captions sticks on screen.  3. Worst one.  So now I've got a permanent relic malfunction effect on my screen.  Everything has that digitized effect, and it makes using the scan feature very difficult.  Other annoying but tolerable problems:1. I can't pick up a fair number of items.  They have the symbol over them, but they can't be interacted with.  This is usually in the form of junk laying around, but it also happens with dead robots.  2. Clipping through buildings.  I am the type that tries to climb over things that weren't supposed to be.  If you try to climb buildings you will find this all over.  But it also just randomly happens too. 3. Inventory.  All of it...  There isn't a good way to tell how much ammo you have, other than equipping a gun.  It doesn't tell  you how much ammo you actually craft.  You can carry 9,999,999 crafting units, but only 100 sniper rounds, 700 of the others.  When scrapping grenades and some other items, they don't disappear until you switch and scrap something else.  If you have a decked out epic pistol fully modded, I no longer can see anything on it's stats.  Hovering over it won't show anything, and this also makes it that way for any other pistol.  When crafting, the dps on weapons changes randomly depending on when you click on it.  Some items that stack, if you scrap them, then make more, you can't scrap the new ones.  You can't sell unused cyberware.  Nothing tells you it's level, unless you are too low to use it (important for upgrading, as lower level items will end up costing more materials to reach the same stats). Every weapon compares to the weapon in the 1 spot.  Even in the selection for the 3 spot, hovering over a different weapon still shows the stats of the weapon in 1.  Nothing tells you what item mods/attachments go to what.  I would like to know if the scope attaches to a weapon, or what goes with which limb weapon before buying them. 4.  Tagging things in the scan mode.  After pining enemies it is still difficult to tag enemies.  If there are any interact able items in the way, they get tagged instead of the enemies.  Sometimes it just tags one enemy, even when there is a gap, it won't let me tag the other.  Some enemies just straight up won't show up after using ping. Things that disappoint:1.  The city isn't living like they tried to show it was.     a. Aside from scripted events, the pedestrian npcs just pop in and walk in a line.  Sometimes even literally walking through fire without caring.  And when I say pop in, within a few feet of me.  And to highlight the lack of character creation, I notice two main groups of npcs.  One are the children that all look the same and walk the same, and two are the big fat men that all look the same an walk the same too.  In general, there was a lot of changes in clothes, but really there weren't that many different looking npcs. Really could have replaced them all with cardboard cutouts for what they do for the game.    b.  I don't think vehicles even bother with actual traffic lights.  I've seen them drive through red lights and stop at green lights.  They don't seem to have any point other than to run you over.  It feels like they were just an after thought.  They could have taken notes from other games on this.   c.  The city doesn't care.  It seems like no matter what you do, nothing changes except with main characters. 2.  The vehicles   a.  There's no garage.  By this I mean like a certain other game, you can't steal or acquire a car and keep it.  You also have no customization available.    b.  They drive like a Flintstones vehicle.  Not much for acceleration, no braking, and feel like they are made of solid stone. The exception is when you get the sports cars, which cost 150k   c.  Scripted ncp vehicles are horrible.  It doesn't matter what you park in front of them, they act like it doesn't weigh anything and push through.  They have instant acceleration an breaking.  Seriously, watch it on the display with Panam.   d.  See 1 b3.  Hacking. They don't do a very good job describing any of this.  Cyberdeck ram is for quickhacks of people.  Buffer is for breach protocol.  The detonate grenade quickhack which was shown right away in the tutorial I still haven't found in the game.  4.  Sandevistan and Berserk are not explained at all5.  The cold blood skills in the cool attribute isn't explained at all6.  The buildings are all just for show, most can't be entered.  I understand this, but at the same time it's annoying.7.  The cool skills with throwing knives require actual attack knives to be thrown.  And you can't pick them up after. 8.  NPC enemy AI.  Like most games, if they become fully alerted they know exactly where you are from then on.  They run around all crazy.  They trip on anything.  9.  All the other unmentioned random glitches. Mostly texture and animations.  10.  The things I forgot before typing this.",cant recommend this game at this time for this price  some spoilers  a lot of this are things i wish they would fix ive really tried to give this game a good

"I was really looking forward to this game.  But very disappointing overall so far! I would rate this game a 5/10 (the graphics are 4 of the 10 - the game play is 1).  The graphics are really pretty good.  I have not had multiple crashes like a lot of folks.  But the game play so far is mostly just stupid and the story so far is obscured by the ghastly AI and lack of ability to actually play the game.  The UI is horrible!  Lots of places are so dark you cant even see what you are supposed to do, much less see an enemy, see things to loot, or even see exits. Things you are told to do often don't make any sense at all.  I am tired of being shot and killed through solid concrete cover *sigh.  Don't make the mistake of doing a tutorial - you can easily get stuck in the tutorial and nothing can get you out except to reload the game before the tutorial starts and never do it.  Trying to drive on a PC is a freakin nightmare (it really should be easy -but it is ridiculously difficult - so I refuse to even drive now -  I just run everywhere. If some task tries to require me to drive I just don't even do it).  I cannot BELIEVE these are the people that gave us The Witcher: All the developers they had for Witcher must be on vacation and the devs that are left all need psych meds or to go to school or something.

"This game is OK. In 2020, when this game released it was awful and ????????. The biggest reason for me? The intentional lying about what this game was, its not an open ended RPG with branching stories, its a linear story open world with some small RPG elements. So, since launch what has noteworthy things improved with the game disregarding stability and bugs? New cars, New guns, ability to buy a few apartments and various cut content like quests being put into the game.

"TL:dr Guns  got shooty shooty good, but buggy game, weird cars, and the story falling apart has me telling others to steer clear. Not sad I got it, but sad it could have been much more.Gunplay in this game is amazing,  but there are several mechanics that dont seem to  really  work, to craft something  you gotta work through  several missions to get enough money  to buy materials, I hoarded materials in every mission in game  and it got me enough to craft a slightly better iconic  weapon, including purchasing hundreds  of other crafting materials from  shops, disassembling all weapons, armor that I found for  a 20 hour period. Would like to see more useful ways to use crafting.Cars drive like  on butter, certain  ones are alright but many will spin  out if you try to turn without going to a  near  stop, and for those missions where you need to follow someone, thats a big pain.Had several moments where I had to restart, cause certain dialogue trees would  crap out, or key items  wouldnt spawn, once  had  entire audio lines for  clubs and  characters stop working, and had to restart the game entirelyLots of the side story elements are great,  the romantic paths all have something different and are  some of the best storytelling in the  whole game. Though for many characters, having only one romantic option available to  you and not having at  least two or three options for your characters is lame in my opinion,  I would like to have  choice on what  kind of partner I can have.Spoilers for  main storyI was hooked for Act Two, and enjoyed  the pacing, Act One  being the warmup, which I felt was handled okay, but the  ending,  with no ending to have V ""win"", after you  spent all game   doing so, feeling like you had plenty of control, clearing out hordes of gangsters and corpos to  be  told it was all a waste of time.  Real big letdown. Would have liked to have seen more consistancy with Johnny, having a touchy feely moment at one second and him being a crab apple the next.

"Played through it a couple times on launch on console, only recently got it on PC.Awesome game, definitely a must-play.Due to its ambition, the time it took to develop, and the excellent reputation of the developer, it generated too much hype to be able to live up to. And due to the performance issues and bugs at launch, it didn't sell as well as it could, so development wrapped up and they're going back on their promise for delivering as much DLC as the Witcher 3 got, releasing just one expansion, and have already started moving on to the sequel. Sadly, this means that it'll never become what it could have been. Perhaps the sequel will do a better job.There is a petition though to try and get CD's attention:https://www.change.org/p/cyberpunk-2077-deserves-a-2nd-expansion-2fd799a5-d204-457f-9a6d-33549fdc89c0/u/30971167But the game IS fantastic, and worth playing.At least with the sequel being in the unreal engine it should make it far more moddable.",played through it a couple times on launch on console only recently got it on pcawesome game definitely a mustplaydue to its ambition the time it took to develop and the excellent reputation of the developer it generated too much hype to be able to live up to and due to the performance issues and bugs at launch it didnt sell as well as it could so development wrapped up and theyre going back on their promise for delivering as much dlc as the witcher  got releasing just one expansion and have already started moving on to the sequel sadly this means that itll never become what it could have been perhaps the sequel will do a better jobthere is a petition though to try and get cds attentionhttpswwwchangeorgpcyberpunkdeservesandexpansionfdadfadfdccubut the game is fantastic and worth playingat least with the sequel being in the unreal engine it should make it far more moddable,played couple time launch console recently got pcawesome game definitely mustplaydue ambition time took develop excellent reputation developer generated much hype able live due performance issue bug launch didnt sell well could development wrapped theyre going back promise delivering much dlc witcher got releasing one expansion already started moving sequel sadly mean itll never become could perhaps sequel better jobthere petition though try get cd attentionhttpswwwchangeorgpcyberpunkdeservesandexpansionfdadfadfdccubut game fantastic worth playingat least sequel unreal engine make far moddable,Positive

"Beyond all the mega issues and controversies about this game, I have to admit that I haven't in particular felt the same way about most of the claims about the performance of this game. And I have to emphasize on the fact that this review is not discussing the performance of the game at any cost. The video game on its own is of course facing some optimization issues in consoles and in few cases in PC. However I am in the apparent ""minority"" that has yet to face any issue at all, regarding crashes, game breaking bugs etc. The only bugs I have ever witnessed are render bugs/visual bugs, most of which I find hysterical and actually genuinely enjoy its existence in the game. In terms of the actual game play and story, this is a phenomenal game, in no means was it over-hyped of its capabilities. The large side of quests, side hustles, open world map is truly fantastic. For a person with my specifications, I found it easily to run at Minimum Ray Tracing settings. Which is more than what many can ask for with how much power this game demands. This is a game worth buying and certainly not worth refunding, unless you're a console player. In that case... Unfortunate is what I can say.*edit* A few months down the line, I take a look back at this game and I see a great deal of improvement, performance wise there is still a huge issue regarding that, unfortunately nothing can excuse their rushed decision to release the game.

"Well, I waited until I'd completed the game to write this.I've heard about the bugs and crashes, and I didn't experience that many. I had a problem with my inventory and a crash after I'd completed the game. The AI is a bit dumb, the cars aren't great to drive, and controls at times can feel clunky and unrefined.But you know what? It doesn't matter one little bit. The game and story are absolutely outstanding. The dialogue options you receive are brilliant, the characters are great and everything is so well written. The game looks stunning, even though I'm playing on an old 1070 at the moment. The music rivals that of Doom. And I don't say that gingerly. The radio music, the club music. Just great to listen to. And the ending. Oh man, the ending I chose, the music that follows that, with the credits and what happens in the credits just fit so well. Right in the ???????? feels!

"Spent the past 5 days playing nothing but Cyberpunk 2077. Yes, I did play 43+ hours of the game. The thing is, I needed a fallout fix. This did fill the void, but there was no challenge. The hardest/ most challenging part of the game was trying not to get one shoted by an explosives in the environment. In the state its in, no I do not recommend this game for the price. The ai is not good. I have an rtx 2070 on high with some custom adjustments, got 55- 65 fps the whole game with no drops below that, so it is playable in that aspect if you have the specs. The side missions are well written, along with just most of the dialogue and characters. However, for the price, your better off waiting for futures patches. The state the game it is in, I'm just gonna say its O.K. if you can run it with higher settings. Pros :- Beautiful Open World- Well written dialogue - Keanu ReevesCons :- 79.99 CAD- Driving physics are donkey- Some side task are really tedious- Maxed street cred by hour 20, and I know there was still about 70% more tasks atleast to check out- AI is so bad, theyre either too easy or dominate.- Most if not all environmental explosives will one shot you (realistic but i can tank a grenade and rocket launcher so???? CDPR please)- Rushed triple a game, the first time in a long time I bought one on day one, and I am yet again reminded why I never do that.It did its job of filling the void for me in terms of a fallout game, but outside of the dialogue its pretty bare boned. Crafting is also a useless mechanic since you can almost always find a better weapon in the world, which made putting points into my technical skill kindof wasted, even though I just used it for opening doors after that point and the 5% armour boost per level. save your money, mod you favourite fallout/skyrim game or play outerworlds, I assure you at the end of the day you'd be happier with where your money and time went.August 16th 2022Pretty good game, holds up now since its optimized and quests arent AS buggy.",spent the past  days playing nothing but cyberpunk  yes i did play  hours of the game the thing is i needed a fallout fix this did fill the void but there was no challenge the hardest most challenging part of the game was trying not to get one shoted by an explosives in the environment in the state its in no i do not recommend this game for the price the ai is not good i have an rtx  on high with some custom adjustments got   fps the whole game with no drops below that so it is playable in that aspect if you have the specs the side missions are well written along with just most of the dialogue and characters however for the price your better off waiting for futures patches the state the game it is in im just gonna say its ok if you can run it with higher settings pros  beautiful open world well written dialogue  keanu reevescons   cad driving physics are donkey some side task are really tedious maxed street cred by hour  and i know there was still about  more tasks atleast to check out ai is so bad theyre either too easy or dominate most if not all environmental explosives will one shot you realistic but i can tank a grenade and rocket launcher so cdpr please rushed triple a game the first time in a long time i bought one on day one and i am yet again reminded why i never do thatit did its job of filling the void for me in terms of a fallout game but outside of the dialogue its pretty bare boned crafting is also a useless mechanic since you can almost always find a better weapon in the world which made putting points into my technical skill kindof wasted even though i just used it for opening doors after that point and the  armour boost per level save your money mod you favourite falloutskyrim game or play outerworlds i assure you at the end of the day youd be happier with where your money and time wentaugust th pretty good game holds up now since its optimized and quests arent as buggy,spent past day playing nothing cyberpunk yes play hour game thing needed fallout fix fill void challenge hardest challenging part game trying get one shoted explosive environment state recommend game price ai good rtx high custom adjustment got fps whole game drop playable aspect spec side mission well written along dialogue character however price better waiting future patch state game im gon na say ok run higher setting pro beautiful open world well written dialogue keanu reevescons cad driving physic donkey side task really tedious maxed street cred hour know still task atleast check ai bad theyre either easy dominate environmental explosive one shot realistic tank grenade rocket launcher cdpr please rushed triple game first time long time bought one day one yet reminded never thatit job filling void term fallout game outside dialogue pretty bare boned crafting also useless mechanic since almost always find better weapon world made putting point technical skill kindof wasted even though used opening door point armour boost per level save money mod favourite falloutskyrim game play outerworlds assure end day youd happier money time wentaugust th pretty good game hold since optimized quest arent buggy,Negative

"A DISAPPOINTING, HALF-FINISHED MESS1. Worse-than-bad AI: Don’t even get me started on this. The NPCs are super dumb, even dumber than their counterparts in GTA: SA, which came out 15 years ago! My major complaint is that they lack proper responses and behave in a strange way, which makes them feel like robots rather than real people. For example, they never fight back, almost don’t have any physics, always drive in a very stupid way, and seldom ever say anything to the player. Plus, the police system is a piece of trash, the cops are highly irresponsive, spawn right next to the player, and never do car chases. I swear to god even GTA 3 did a better job than this. In a word, all these terrible NPC behaviors have made the city feel very dead and greatly undercut its beauty.3. Inconsistent context and useless life paths: Aside from a 30 minutes long prologue, nothing is affected by what life path I choose, which again is totally different from what CDPR promised. Besides, why would V, whether he/she is an employee or a street kid or an outsider, would want to help the NCPD fight all those gang members? I mean, isn’t the police corrupt and despised in a cyberpunk world? In this case, V, especially if he/she is a street kid, should instead help his/her gangster friends fight back. And V is gaining “street cred” for being a police pet? How absurd. 3. Empty world: Night City, where the game mainly focuses on, again greatly disappointed me. It does look gorgeous with all the neon lights and skyscrapers, but deep down it’s quite empty and boring. There are no interactions I can have with it: Most of the shops and vendors cannot be visited, and the ones that can be just pop a menu. Meanwhile, I can’t do many things in NC aside from doing quests. It’s very weird that I can’t do some minigames in a city this gigantic, this together with its terrible (nonexistent) AI make Night City feel like a hollow and dead place. In my opinion, even a small town like Valentine in RDR 2 feels way more lively than this superficial “city”.4. Messy Combat: -There are way too many weapons with way too little difference between them, aside from some random stats.-New weapons constantly replace old ones, for like every five minutes, whereas in The Witcher 3 I can use a good weapon for a long time. -Enemies are too bullet-spongy, it’s so weird that a bandit would take three fully-charged shotgun bullets before he dies.-Some skills are no more than “XX+5”, which is really boring. -Stealth system is broken, as enemies don’t have a “suspicion” stage after they hear (see) something wrong. Instead, they start shooting right away. -The entire crafting section feels unnecessary, since weapons I get from dead bodies are usually better. -Inventory menu is unclear and confusing, there is not even an option to categorize guns based on their types. -Weapon stat menu is also badly designed, I can’t even see what level a weapon is at.  -The weapon wheel is hard to use.-Katanas and bullets seldom result in chopped body parts or even much blood, and It’s hard to see if I hit the target or not. 5. Details: Some other things I’m unsatisfied with.-There’s no “style” in this game. I’m constantly forced to put on ugly weapons or clothes because they have higher stats.-There are no barber and tattoo shops in Night City, and there’s no way to customize the character’s body after starting the game.-Why is it so easy to change cyber wares? I thought there would be an animation.-There are way too many junks to pick, like for every 5 steps I walk there are at least 1 piece of junk, is this cyberpunk or some kind of utopian?-Stuff on the ground are sometimes hard to pick.-The presence of foods is pointless, as their buffs are minimal and it’s difficult to find them in the inventory.-The player doesn’t have proper body responses, like shaking after taking damage.-Cars are weird to drive, and don’t look much differently after taking damage.-I can’t see what’s behind me while driving in first person.-Futuristic tires cannot be damaged by futuristic bullets.-The “change time” option leaves only time changed, NPCs do not change position after the process. -The player can’t leave bloody footprints after stepping on blood.A lot of criticism people have posted online concentrate on the bugs and optimization. But can the game be considered amazing (or even good) without these problems? I don’t think so. Cyberpunk 2077 does have a decent story and beautiful aesthetics, but almost everything else is handled very poorly: The world is superficial, the NPCs are dead-like, the weapon stats and skills are designed in a bad way, even the story is kind of inconsistent. The game feels half-finished, and in my opinion it definitely does not deserve all the 9s and 10s given (for whatever reason) by the game reviewers. But that’s not even the worst part.The worst part is: CDPR LIED. They took advantage of our trust and traded it for easy cash. Here are some of their lies:-Metro and taxis are transportations in NC: There are no ridable metro nor taxies.-NC has a lot of vertical explorations: Almost no building is enterable, where is this “ vertical exploration” from? (Don’t pretend climbing some ladders and pipes was “exploration”)-The world is immersive and NPCs are designed to have daily routines: You call a city where I can do nothing immersive? And NPCs, who don’t even have physics are designed to do what? Blindly walking back and forth and then disappear? -Gangs play an important role: They are not involved in the story much.-Life paths will have profound effects throughout the story: As I said, the experiences are pretty much the same.-There are multiple ways to deal with a mission: Except the one mission you showed us in the trailer, I don’t see anything like that. -Fashion is everything in Night City: Is that why there is not even a tattoo or barber shop in the city?-Players will not need to put on ugly clothes only for higher stats: Seriously?-In-depth weapon customization: Seriously?-Enemies will not be bullet-spongy: Seriously?-The driving will be better than games like GTA V: Even the super sport cars have strange handling, you call this better than GTA?-The game will be polished as well as RDR 2: I don’t remember RDR 2 having so many problems and things missing when it first came out. -There will be no more delays: I don’t even have to talk about this. -We delayed the game so that the game can reach a Metacritic score no less than 9: You did take your time to “persuade” the medias to ignore the fact that your game is a half-made mess, that I must admit.-The game has a PC recommended requirement of GTX 1060: You call medium/30fps recommended? -The game will basically be bug-free at first launch: Hilarious.-The game runs well on base consoles: You even made a fake video to demonstrate this ha? How CLEVER! CDPR gained our trust because of The Witcher 3 as well as its amazing DLCs, like many others, I put my faith in them and believed every word they said. Turned out they are no better than the likes of EA-at least EA does not lie this much. CDPR promised so much that we did not mind how long they took, how much advertising they did, and how many delays happened, all that could be put aside so long as the final product lives up to their promises. But it does not. The product is half-finished, and lacks so many things previously promised. What a disgrace! I can’t believe I waited 8 long years for this.What CDPR did was inexcusable. It’s by no means too much to ask a company to deliver its promised product at the promised time. Instead of putting all their efforts into developing and polishing the game, CDPR spent so much time marketing: They invited Keanu, showed off their “in-depth genital customization”, posted so many videos about things don’t exist, they went way too far. I trusted CDPR before, I’m afraid I’m not going to do that ever again.",a disappointing halffinished mess worsethanbad ai don’t even get me started on this the npcs are super dumb even dumber than their counterparts in gta sa which came out  years ago my major complaint is that they lack proper responses and behave in a strange way which makes them feel like robots rather than real people for example they never fight back almost don’t have any physics always drive in a very stupid way and seldom ever say anything to the player plus the police system is a piece of trash the cops are highly irresponsive spawn right next to the player and never do car chases i swear to god even gta  did a better job than this in a word all these terrible npc behaviors have made the city feel very dead and greatly undercut its beauty inconsistent context and useless life paths aside from a  minutes long prologue nothing is affected by what life path i choose which again is totally different from what cdpr promised besides why would v whether heshe is an employee or a street kid or an outsider would want to help the ncpd fight all those gang members i mean isn’t the police corrupt and despised in a cyberpunk world in this case v especially if heshe is a street kid should instead help hisher gangster friends fight back and v is gaining “street cred” for being a police pet how absurd  empty world night city where the game mainly focuses on again greatly disappointed me it does look gorgeous with all the neon lights and skyscrapers but deep down it’s quite empty and boring there are no interactions i can have with it most of the shops and vendors cannot be visited and the ones that can be just pop a menu meanwhile i can’t do many things in nc aside from doing quests it’s very weird that i can’t do some minigames in a city this gigantic this together with its terrible nonexistent ai make night city feel like a hollow and dead place in my opinion even a small town like valentine in rdr  feels way more lively than this superficial “city” messy combat there are way too many weapons with way too little difference between them aside from some random statsnew weapons constantly replace old ones for like every five minutes whereas in the witcher  i can use a good weapon for a long time enemies are too bulletspongy it’s so weird that a bandit would take three fullycharged shotgun bullets before he diessome skills are no more than “xx” which is really boring stealth system is broken as enemies don’t have a “suspicion” stage after they hear see something wrong instead they start shooting right away the entire crafting section feels unnecessary since weapons i get from dead bodies are usually better inventory menu is unclear and confusing there is not even an option to categorize guns based on their types weapon stat menu is also badly designed i can’t even see what level a weapon is at  the weapon wheel is hard to usekatanas and bullets seldom result in chopped body parts or even much blood and it’s hard to see if i hit the target or not  details some other things i’m unsatisfied withthere’s no “style” in this game i’m constantly forced to put on ugly weapons or clothes because they have higher statsthere are no barber and tattoo shops in night city and there’s no way to customize the character’s body after starting the gamewhy is it so easy to change cyber wares i thought there would be an animationthere are way too many junks to pick like for every  steps i walk there are at least  piece of junk is this cyberpunk or some kind of utopianstuff on the ground are sometimes hard to pickthe presence of foods is pointless as their buffs are minimal and it’s difficult to find them in the inventorythe player doesn’t have proper body responses like shaking after taking damagecars are weird to drive and don’t look much differently after taking damagei can’t see what’s behind me while driving in first personfuturistic tires cannot be damaged by futuristic bulletsthe “change time” option leaves only time changed npcs do not change position after the process the player can’t leave bloody footprints after stepping on blooda lot of criticism people have posted online concentrate on the bugs and optimization but can the game be considered amazing or even good without these problems i don’t think so cyberpunk  does have a decent story and beautiful aesthetics but almost everything else is handled very poorly the world is superficial the npcs are deadlike the weapon stats and skills are designed in a bad way even the story is kind of inconsistent the game feels halffinished and in my opinion it definitely does not deserve all the s and s given for whatever reason by the game reviewers but that’s not even the worst partthe worst part is cdpr lied they took advantage of our trust and traded it for easy cash here are some of their liesmetro and taxis are transportations in nc there are no ridable metro nor taxiesnc has a lot of vertical explorations almost no building is enterable where is this “ vertical exploration” from don’t pretend climbing some ladders and pipes was “exploration”the world is immersive and npcs are designed to have daily routines you call a city where i can do nothing immersive and npcs who don’t even have physics are designed to do what blindly walking back and forth and then disappear gangs play an important role they are not involved in the story muchlife paths will have profound effects throughout the story as i said the experiences are pretty much the samethere are multiple ways to deal with a mission except the one mission you showed us in the trailer i don’t see anything like that fashion is everything in night city is that why there is not even a tattoo or barber shop in the cityplayers will not need to put on ugly clothes only for higher stats seriouslyindepth weapon customization seriouslyenemies will not be bulletspongy seriouslythe driving will be better than games like gta v even the super sport cars have strange handling you call this better than gtathe game will be polished as well as rdr  i don’t remember rdr  having so many problems and things missing when it first came out there will be no more delays i don’t even have to talk about this we delayed the game so that the game can reach a metacritic score no less than  you did take your time to “persuade” the medias to ignore the fact that your game is a halfmade mess that i must admitthe game has a pc recommended requirement of gtx  you call mediumfps recommended the game will basically be bugfree at first launch hilariousthe game runs well on base consoles you even made a fake video to demonstrate this ha how clever cdpr gained our trust because of the witcher  as well as its amazing dlcs like many others i put my faith in them and believed every word they said turned out they are no better than the likes of eaat least ea does not lie this much cdpr promised so much that we did not mind how long they took how much advertising they did and how many delays happened all that could be put aside so long as the final product lives up to their promises but it does not the product is halffinished and lacks so many things previously promised what a disgrace i can’t believe i waited  long years for thiswhat cdpr did was inexcusable it’s by no means too much to ask a company to deliver its promised product at the promised time instead of putting all their efforts into developing and polishing the game cdpr spent so much time marketing they invited keanu showed off their

"---To start off this game does not captivate me like other games do, I feel as if I'm at a point where I'm forcing myself to play it. I tried all 3 different endings and without spoilers I can tell you that Corpo is weak and lacks good narrative and gives you very little insight in how corpos work in the universe, Street kid is okay, but is still lacking in good dialogue while also not giving you a true in depth look at how gangs and similar groups work, and finally Nomad is the best with an equal amount of game play and dialogue while also giving you a close look in the lifestyle of Nomad clans. And while all three are unique once the cutscene  Nomads dialogue however can be cringy, and awkward at times. All 3 give us, the player, plenty of room to create our own backstories, but that seems to be one of the only dedicated RPG elements to the game. Many dialogue choices seem pointless as the outcome of the choice is the same for most if not all quests. I don't want to feel as if I'm forcing myself when playing games like this or any other. It's campaign has not captivated me like CDPR's ""The Witcher 3"" and while I understand they are two separate games with completely different narratives, you come to expect a campaign that will blow you away coming from this company. However the narrative is very slow and awkward and many lines of dialogue come off poorly or the way they're said is lacking in emotion, or has too much emotion when neither are needed. These lines come from major characters such as Johnny Silverhand, V, V's companion, V's friends, to even the non essential NPC's. ---The combat is one of the better mechanics in the game, with both gun play and melee mostly seamless and has a similar vibe to ""Tom Clancys: The Division."" Unfortunately stealth is a mechanic that seems broken or established incorrectly, often times I would find myself being caught while never once showing myself to the enemy and only utilizing hacks from a safe distance. Having to reload a save many times for certain missions. Driving is arguably the worst mechanic as you'll find yourself gliding and drifting across the street more so than driving straight, or hitting a wall on a motorcycle and finding yourself flying. And while standard melee combat is good, the mission brawls much like in ""TES V: Skyrim"" are not challenging whatsoever and can be accomplished relatively easy even with low to no melee skill progression. Next for combat we get to the police, where you kill an innocent NPC cop and drone appear down the street, chase you for a few second until you hide behind a trash can, and leave. Making the whole interaction very boring and leaving much to be desired. Once you get to police level 3 MAX-TAC shows up which can actually be a problem but will leave after you hide for just a few moments. I was hoping that CDPR would give us a new, fresh experience to police notoriety with Cyberpunk but it feels like GTA V dumbed down at this point. With the traffic mechanic worse than GTA V. You car could be parked on the sidewalk because parking spots seem to not exist whatsoever, and have just a pixel of your vehicle in the street and all of the sudden you have a traffic jam. Endless honks and shouts will be heard but never once will you see moving cars.---The bugs are still apparent, with graphics taking a few seconds to a few minutes to load, cars popping up in the street out of nowhere, and a multitude of others. ---Finally, I have to say I'm extremely disappointed with this game. And while CDPR is on the case about sending out regular hotfixes which may make the game more bearable in the future, I don't foresee myself playing this game much longer if at all. Cyberpunk has left a sour taste in my mouth, and one I don't feel I'll be rid of for a while.",to start off this game does not captivate me like other games do i feel as if im at a point where im

"Unfortunately i do not recommend this game in its current state.My PC specs are   CPU i7-7700k@4.6Ghz   GPU RTX 2080 S   RAM 16Gb Graphics At best its ok there's nothing to write home about and that's on high and ultra settings. At 1080p the game looks blurry and have this weird ghosting effect when things are in motion. I have turned off motion blur, chromatic aberration, lens flare, and film grain and its still there. Also there is a lot of texture bugs and clipping issues that everyone is experiencing. Don't even talk about ray tracing it doesn't add anything to make the game look any better and most will turn it off and disregard it. The Devs should have focused more on making the game look better than trying to rely on ray tracing , i think this feature should have came way later in the games life.Performance With my pc specs above and most of my settings on high or ultra with dlss on auto i was getting around 55-89 FPS @1080p. But after playing for a while my game starts getting bad performance barely getting above 45 FPS anywhere i go causing me to have to quit the game and launch again.Customization The character customization is actually quite nice although i would have liked to see more body types but i kinda understand. The cybernetics choices are kind of underwhelming seeing how diverse and different the NPCs are. i was hoping to get a like a robotic arm, leg, or face plate but you can't. After creating your character there is no way of changing it afterwards not even your hairstyle there is no barbershops/hairdressers in night city. There are no car dealerships ether , during the development of this game they scrapped car customization so you can only have the car colors they have set for you and your only way to acquire cars is though fixers. There is a bit of variety in the guns but the gun attachments are lackluster to say the very least theres only like 8 different scopes to get and only 2 suppressors for a game the revolves around gunplay and weapons thats sad no muzzle breaks, compensators, laser lights or flashlights. Some guns already have preset paintjobs/camos already on them i would have liked to choose my own paintjob after getting the weapon.The storyI feel like you kind of get thrown into this world not knowing much backstory of why you are here in the first place or why you are doing it from the beginning other than to make money (eddies). The game doesn't even explain how you know any of these fixers you just kinda play along. Picking your life path isn't as important most would think for an RPG game at best it can open up a couple extra lines of dialogue but is mostly disregarded. The trailer talked about romancing people but from what i heard its only 2 people each gender thats it you can't flirt with anyone let alone talk to anyone NPCs are kind of lifeless.OverallFor a game that supposedly went ""gold"" at best went nickel or better yet double plywood i feel like i paid for a alpha of cyberpunk 2077 more then a game. But i still enjoy what they have in the game this is my first CDPR game, people harped so much about witcher and how this team saved that game CDPR has a very ambitious project that i hope they can complete one day i really love the vibe and aesthetic of night city and the world CDPR have created i still believe in the city of dreams so wake the f**k up samurai we still have a city to burn.this

"There are a lot of spoilers here so read if you are ok with that.I formed an imaginary friendship with one of the characters in the prologue, what happened next made me cry, I know it sound's so silly, but I was immersed in the world that I could not foresee how my mind has actually turned imagination into reality ..it took me a while to stop googling how to save this person/ can you do something to keep XYZ alive, it's a great story with a lot of potential, but needs some polishing, some of the voice actors were so brilliant to a point they have made the game so desirable to me, elevated the game play and made me believe am inside the scenario and not just a character clearing areas with guns..I do appreciate the ability to turn nudity off from the menu, and I was able to enjoy the rest of the game very well! so I don't agree with those who say it's pointless to play CD projekt games if you are not into that stuff, I skip scenes and am good to go!If It was for me I would expand the game and create more classes, secondary characters, update the police system, open up new areas, ability to travel, go to different countries like ( SA, Morroco, France, China, SIngapore) change endings so the game can continue in a way that it's not over and the only way back to keep playing is  by going to a previous save ( the point of no return),   they have really done a great job with hacking, scanning areas, environment, buildings, combat, gear, weapons, it feels like you are in a cyberworld, and they could have made more top notch areas,  added cyborgs that would hunt you down and you would have to create a team to beat them , areas for corporates with no crime, upsacle clubs...etc so the game can continue to live. I have been lucky to play during the recent patches and not the super buggy era of the game so I would say I didn't face many. It's very unique and you will enjoy it far beyond that being frustrated by it, my game crashed a lot but I still enjoyed it when it didn't ..I would wish for this game to allow players to invite other gamers to their world or create  online zones.Wish there was a way I could play the game without the arasaka family but this is what they were going for and the main plot was revolving around them ( they are the least likable, interesting characters in the game).",there are a lot of spoilers here so read if you are ok with thati formed an imaginary friendship with one of the characters in the prologue what happened next made me cry i know it sounds so silly but i was immersed in the world that i could not foresee how my mind has actually turned imagination into reality it took me a while to stop googling how to save this person can you do something to keep xyz alive its a great story with a lot of potential but needs some polishing some of the voice actors were so brilliant to a point they have made the game so desirable to me elevated the game play and made me believe am inside the scenario and not just a character clearing areas with gunsi do appreciate the ability to turn nudity off from the menu and i was able to enjoy the rest of the game very well so i dont agree with those who say its pointless to play cd projekt games if you are not into that stuff i skip scenes and am good to goif it was for me i would expand the game and create more classes secondary characters update the police system open up new areas ability to travel go to different countries like  sa morroco france china singapore change endings so the game can continue in a way that its not over and the only way back to keep playing is  by going to a previous save  the point of no return   they have really done a great job with hacking scanning areas environment buildings combat gear weapons it feels like you are in a cyberworld and they could have made more top notch areas  added cyborgs that would hunt you down and you would have to create a team to beat them  areas for corporates with no crime upsacle clubsetc so the game can continue to live i have been lucky to play during the recent patches and not the super buggy era of the game so i would say i didnt face many its very unique and you will enjoy it far beyond that being frustrated by it my game crashed a lot but i still enjoyed it when it didnt i would wish for this game to allow players to invite other gamers to their world or create  online zoneswish there was a way i could play the game without the arasaka family but this is what they were going for and the main plot was revolving around them  they are the least likable interesting characters in the game,lot spoiler read ok thati formed imaginary friendship one character prologue happened next made cry know sound silly immersed world could foresee mind actually turned imagination reality took stop googling save person something keep xyz alive great story lot potential need polishing voice actor brilliant point made game desirable elevated game play made believe inside scenario character clearing area gunsi appreciate ability turn nudity menu able enjoy rest game well dont agree say pointless play cd projekt game stuff skip scene good goif would expand game create class secondary character update police system open new area ability travel go different country like sa morroco france china singapore change ending game continue way way back keep playing going previous save point return really done great job hacking scanning area environment building combat gear weapon feel like cyberworld could made top notch area added cyborg would hunt would create team beat area corporates crime upsacle clubsetc game continue live lucky play recent patch super buggy era game would say didnt face many unique enjoy far beyond frustrated game crashed lot still enjoyed didnt would wish game allow player invite gamers world create online zoneswish way could play game without arasaka family going main plot revolving around least likable interesting character game,Positive

"Like so many things in life, this game exists with its flaws. It may be true that for example pedestrian AI and variety is worse than the games that came 10 years before CP77, however no other game can offer you the same atmosphere and ambiance regarding the ""cyberpunk"" genre. As far as its story, its up there with games like Skyrim and OG Assasin's Creed for me. If you are one of those people who eagerly jumped on the hate wagon, hating the game for the sake of hating it(wow so edgy), and if you are unable to form an opinion based on your own experience playing the game because you are afraid of acting against the holy grail of hate this game gets, im afraid you will never be able to experience this game from a non-biased perspective and see the game for what it really is.

"I enjoyed this game.I definitely recommend playing on PC if you have the hardware to handle it. I played at 1440p with i7-9750H and RTX 2070, Ultra preset with a few tweaks, no RT, quality DLSS. I didn't want to wait, but I understand why reviews have said to wait a few months for the patches before immersing yourself. You only get that 1st go around once and I will admit, the amount of bugs I still encountered break the immersion. In spite of the great content, when their is enough immersion breaking, it can ruin the experience during what can be otherwise far more powerful moments. With that being said, it's getting better, more hot fixes are coming and there are a lot of great guides out their to tweak for optimal performance and quality. Considering I've spent close to 100 hours in the game at a cost of $60, that comes to about 60 cents an hour. So great value even at full price for me but I'm the type to dig down the different side quests, explore and not rush the experience. On that note - definitely explore the side quests and gigs. As many have noted, some are as good if not better than the main story line and add to the context of the world you inhabit in this game.I can appreciate the scope of what they tried to make here. I only wish, like so many, that they took the time to iron out the majority of the bugs, AI and layers of depth they had planned before hitting the store. Immense respect and regard to all the devs that poured their time, energy and life into this. Respect to the portion of management that likely fought for the integrity of what this game was supposed to be, a full vision we may only see partially roll out over time now. And let this be a lesson to the foolish leads of marketing that over-hyped this game into it's own launch demise. Let this be a lesson to the management that did not keep the process on track and grounded. Let this be a lesson to the investors who weren't more engaged with the process and weren't willing to step back and develop the insight into the ROI they could've had if they were willing to let it bake just a little longer in the oven. Let this especially be a lesson to those involved that turned into corporats and never cared about the end product they were offering the world and only focused on their own profits and gains. It goes without say that in most industries, you need win-win situations for long term success. Offer value and the money will anyways come. In a gaming community, you are nothing in the long run if you don't truly care about the experience you are giving your end users, aka the people that are interested in what you create and are willing to pay you money to experience it. You don't publish a book until it's had some thorough proof-reads. Only then you launch the 1st edition.Anyways, I'm probably preaching to choir at this point. We all witnessed what happened with this game launch. In spite of all that, I still had a great experience and would like the people involved in making this game that actually cared about it know that I appreciate what they have worked so hard to create and look forward to the fixes, DLC and further improvements done to this game for when I return sometime later for another play through.

Extremely disappointing game. The city does not feel immersive. The weapons system gives the player no reason to care about legendary weapons because you can just loot higher damage weapons with each level up. The side quests are boring and repetitive. The dialogue is super preachy for no reason and gets to be really cheesy and cringe the further you progress. Everything I was excited for about this game was a let down. This is the last game I will ever prepay for in the rest of my life. Absolutely not worth buying. And the game is still ridiculously buggy 8 months later.Even if you looks past the poor optimization and game breaking glitches deep down Cyber Punk is just a hollow fps shooter that hasn't innovated anything and has taken from everything before it.,extremely disappointing game the city does not feel immersive the weapons system gives the player no reason to care about legendary weapons because you can just loot higher damage weapons with each level up the side quests are boring and repetitive the dialogue is super preachy for no reason and gets to be really cheesy and cringe the further you progress everything i was excited for about this game was a let down this is the last game i will ever prepay for in the rest of my life absolutely not worth buying and the game is still ridiculously buggy  months latereven if you looks past the poor optimization and game breaking glitches deep down cyber punk is just a hollow fps shooter that hasnt innovated anything and has taken from everything before it,extremely disappointing game city feel immersive weapon system give player reason care legendary weapon loot higher damage weapon level side quest boring repetitive dialogue super preachy reason get really cheesy cringe progress everything excited game let last game ever prepay rest life absolutely worth buying game still ridiculously buggy month latereven look past poor optimization game breaking glitch deep cyber punk hollow fps shooter hasnt innovated anything taken everything,Negative

"It breaks my heart to write this review, which I have done after completing the game utterly - all side missions, mini gigs, max level, secret ending, the works. I kept waiting for the game to come together. It didn't. I really was looking forward to this title after Witcher 3. I won't take time to describe the half million bugs of varying magnitudes that plague the title in its current shape. Instead, I'll focus on the utter disappointment of seeing signs all over the place of a rushed game with serious amounts of cut content. The world feels alive for the first few hours, filled with amazing detail and advertisements, but any longer than that, and you realize there is no AI for NPCs, the police don't chase you, cars can't adjust their driving if you are in the way, and there's absolutely no meaningful world content besides a few sidequests (if you are looking for something like Gwent, its just not here. at all.) The main storyline is good, and Keanu Reeves puts in another breathtaking performance basically as himself, so if you're a Reeves fan like I am, maybe it would be worth it to just play only the main storyline and a couple side missions and treat this game like a linear experience, but this game wanted to be Open World like Witcher 3 and GTA and others, and just fails utterly at that. The tragedy is that potential for a better game is all over the place, but this title was -years- away from completion when it was released. I dont expect it will ever be restored to the way it should have been, and thus, unless you REALLY need some more Keanu Reeves in your life, stay away from this one. 4/10",it breaks my heart to write this review which i have done after completing the game utterly  all side missions mini gigs max level secret ending the works i kept waiting for the game to come together it didnt i really was looking forward to this title after witcher  i wont take time to describe the half million bugs of varying magnitudes that plague the title in its current shape instead ill focus on the utter disappointment of seeing signs all over the place of a rushed game with serious amounts of cut content the world feels alive for the first few hours filled with amazing detail and advertisements but any longer than that and you realize there is no ai for npcs the police dont chase you cars cant adjust their driving if you are in the way and theres absolutely no meaningful world content besides a few sidequests if you are looking for something like gwent its just not here at all the main storyline is good and keanu reeves puts in another breathtaking performance basically as himself so if youre a reeves fan like i am maybe it would be worth it to just play only the main storyline and a couple side missions and treat this game like a linear experience but this game wanted to be open world like witcher  and gta and others and just fails utterly at that the tragedy is that potential for a better game is all over the place but this title was years away from completion when it was released i dont expect it will ever be restored to the way it should have been and thus unless you really need some more keanu reeves in your life stay away from this one,break heart write review done completing game utterly side mission mini gig max level secret ending work kept waiting game come together didnt really looking forward title witcher wont take time describe half million bug varying magnitude plague title current shape instead ill focus utter disappointment seeing sign place rushed game serious amount cut content world feel alive first hour filled amazing detail advertisement longer realize ai npc police dont chase car cant adjust driving way there absolutely meaningful world content besides sidequests looking something like gwent main storyline good keanu reef put another breathtaking performance basically youre reef fan like maybe would worth play main storyline couple side mission treat game like linear experience game wanted open world like witcher gta others fails utterly tragedy potential better game place title year away completion released dont expect ever restored way thus unless really need keanu reef life stay away one,Negative

"After finishing the game for the first time, here are my thoughts about it:Pros: -The bonds between characters are well put, especially the relationship between V and Johnny change over time mostly through side quests so if you rush for the main, believe me you won't understand that bond.-The gun play is beyond my expectation, recoils have major impact and the penetration system actually impressed me.-The atmosphere is nice, sometimes you will experience empty road but that's mainly because you are going too fast and in the current built, the environment is not fully loaded yet ( wait a bit at a particular point where you experience ghost town and you will see what i mean ). Jig-Jig street is probably one of the most impressive places.Cons: -Bugs, this has more bugs than the entire amount of pathogen found in a corona virus patient, however i believe they will be patch soon ( same as what they did to The Witcher 3 )-Driving mechanics seem to be a little bit janky ( just a bit weird at first but you will get used to it )-Mediocre melee mechanics, i love the katana and mantis blade but the gloves and boxing stuff seem kinda meh -Bad optimization at launch, yes of course many games suffer from this and so does Witcher 3 but i have faith you will be able to patch it soonOverall, worth the money ?

"Whether the game is for you depends on how invested you where in the hype.For those who expected the perfect immersive cyberpunk experience with endless possibilities where you can write your own story, I would recommend skipping the game and keep dreaming until the next(?) cyberpunk game.Someone without much expectations, will find a decent game with interesting main story and multiple hours of side stories and exceptional voice acting (I can only speak for English VA).In the end, the following points tipped the scale for me to not recommending the game:The life paths are as meaningless as they can get. Not more than 20 minutes before all merge in the same main story. The only difference they make after this are occasional conversation choices with no mayor impact.The whole „you can finish the story without killing anybody“ feels like something they added to advertise an additional play style variant. But the implementation is more than lazy. You just add an cyberware implant mod and all weapons (with some exceptions) are magically non-lethal. After this you can play as usual with the only change being, that the enemies keep breathing after they are down. Some side quests give additional rewards if no enemy was killed. For the main story, I couldn’t see and impact.The same goes for the stealthy approach. You just add silencers to all weapons, crouch and try to keep out of the cone of vision of the enemies. Other than that you can do whatever you want. The enemies are not the brightest and will only react to running or direct vision. Nevertheless you want to quick-save as often as possible, as some enemies may stand around for hours without moving or turning, but as soon as you sneak up behind them, they turn around or start moving. Hopefully this behavior is only a bug and will be patched in the future.The whole quick hack system is littered with bugs. Nearly all „distract enemy“ options are hit or miss (if and how enemies react is completely random), hacked turrets in assist mode have the worst timing for attacking the enemy and disabled cameras turn back on randomly.The combat AI is bad in every aspect. The combat behavior is basic at best. After entering combat, the enemies run to the nearest available cover and start shooting. Melee fighter run straight towards you with no regards to their lives. There will be no flanking maneuvers or anything like that.The driver AI is basically non existent. The traffic moves mostly in straight lines and sometime attempt to turn with various degrees of success. This is especially noticeable in the racing missions. The other drivers only drive in straight lines, crash at every turn, despawn and respawn again directly behind you.The classification for the equipment is confusing. The equipment is classified by colors but without clear level indication. As a result the colors are just meaningless and finding the best item for each slot is cumbersome. This is made worse by the sheer amount of stuff you can pickup. Theoretically that stuff can be used for crafting and upgrading existing gear, but the whole system suffers from the same problem as the item classification itself. In the end, the easiest way for upgrades is to sell everything and buy new weapons from vendors.The level system feels like it was designed with an RPG in mind, but subsequently modified for a shooter. The different attributes are only used to lock out some gameplay parts (e.g. high „body“ for force open locked doors, „intelligence“ for quickly disabling cameras/turrets,…) and the skills behind the different attributes are mostly boring X% dmg boosts for different weapon types. Same goes for the cyberwar upgrades. Nothing gameplay changing (except the double jump feet)The difficulty level of enemies is not displayed in the UI. It is possible that after a mission where you mowed down dozens of corporate security guards equip with the best weapons money can buy, you get killed by this one low life thug with his butter knife in the backyard of a drug den.The wanted system is a total mess and should not exist in this game. If any pedestrians are harmed in any way (regardless if there is a witness or not) , you receive wanted level similar to GTA. Because the AI is not able to simulate patrolling police, the police just spawns directly behind you and start attacking you. Fighting is completely pointless as they will just respawn endlessly. Thankfully it is easy enough to outrun them.This are some (by far not all) of the points which are bugging me most. For some points, especially the problems with the AI, I have my doubts whether this can be patched in the future.I also had lots of the „normal“ bugs as shown in countless videos, but assuming these will be patched soon, these are not the issues. I’m also fortunate enough to play with an RTX3080 with the Nvidia recommended settings in 1440p without mayor FPS drops below 50 FPS.",whether the game is for you depends on how invested you where in

"In Night City you can become anyone.And that's not a doubt. The possibilities of what you can do and who you can be are huge, and so is the world surrounding us, which definitely isn't empty. Honestly, after waiting so long for this game, I'm pretty satisfied with what we finally got.World? Night City and the surrounding area around it are very well done and it feels realistic. Each district feels different which gives the feeling, that you're not walking in the same place. You know where you are and who your enemy is.The storyline? If you're going only with main missions, it may not be so special, the side missions give quite a lot of storyline. After finishing all side missions, main missions, and even getting each ending I can say, that storyline is amazing with very good written characters.Open world activities? They're kinda the same. You just go there, kill some guys, find evidence, etc. The difference here makes gigs and cyberpsychos, especially that every single of them feels different, even if the point of the mission is the same (Steal, kill, etc.). They're good and you don't feel that they're that repetitive. Gameplay? Typical for RPG. You gain EXP, level up skills, and give yourself some perks. The good attitude of that is that you can be whoever you want. A melee berserk, a sneaky technician, high crit gunner, whatever you like, you get it. There is not that much of a grind, at least you don't feel like you need to grind a lot of money or EXP. After doing side missions, sometimes you notice that you have enough money to buy yourself some good cybernetics. Fighting is okay and again, typical for RPG. Driving is something that feels odd at the beginning. With time you get used to cars but on the first try, you feel that cars are very heavy. Police is something that is bad in this game, could even say that very bad. The fact that they're unbalanced is one thing, but escaping them is literally just running 5 meters away. Clothes which are armor in this game, are good, different shops give different clothing style but there are no barbers or anything. Your character will look the same in the end, with no possibility to change the hair or even makeup.Technical side? Well, here my opinion is controversial. We all know that Cyberpunk 2077 has problems with bugs, some people less and some people more. I didn't get that many bugs and I can't really say that much about it. Even if some bugs are appearing, they're mostly fun bugs that don't ruin the game. The thing which definitely is buggy are cars, sometimes their textures don't load on time, but other things? Works normally or bugs are not that serious to make me even notice. AI isn't perfect, but it's not bad as well. Fact, NPC Cars are dumb and civilians sometimes act dumb as well, but the enemy AI or allies AI is good but sometimes it could be better. On High-Ultra settings, the game worked just fine on 30 FPS for me and on Medium, I had stable 60 FPS, and I don't even have that ""very spicy"" PC.OST? Oh boi... I didn't hear such an amazing soundtrack since DOOM: Eternal dropped. I can listen to it for hours, especially ""The Rebel Path"".Is the game worth buying? It is, either on discount or full prize but because of current bugs which are problems for most players, it's better to wait until February/March 2021 with purchase, but if you don't mind bugs (or you're lucky like me to not get them that much), you can buy it right now.

"Works surprisingly well on a radeon 570 GPU. Didn't have any gamebreaking bugs yet, but there are things that'll need some updates, like enemies doing the T-pose randomly. But it's actually not bad in any way. The visuals, even on my mid/low settings are stunning, the Gunplay is briilliant and the Story... dayum. Not sure if modding cars will be possible later on, if not, that's one thing i'd sure wish for. also, the driving physics needs some tweaking. Steering input is way too slow, for example. That, for me, is the biggest thing about driving so far. So, to sum it up. Even in this very early state, the game is a solid 9/10 expirience for me.Edit: Patch 1.2 is out and the Game does run smoother. Way less stuttering, more FPS, and so on...

"Don't buy this game, its basically a scam for now.I say for now, because the ""spirit""/potential of the game is here, it is just not ready and shouldn't have been released now. Not even counting the ridiculous bugs and crashes, the final product has nothing to do with what was showed in the trailers and such.Barely any customization at creation (except your face, you can't even choose your character's height wtf), not any better in game (cant change hairstyle??? you can do that in tf2 lmao and its from 2007, im sure they are game from the 90's where you can change your hair). All the lifepaths are the same after a few minutes. All dialogues options lead to the same results in most cases. AI is broken, its impressive. Probably worst than Skyrim's AI. Combat is fine but not the best. And the most important problem of them all : you cannot interact with anything. Sure there are tons of side quests, but you cannot just wander around, buy things, interact with people. Everything is scripted. Your actions have no impact. This is not what I call a next gen RPG. Not even a rpg at all, more like a light novel with fancy graphics.Again, story is great, visuals are impressive, but this is not what was promised. The game in itself is fun, but I didn't buy it to ""have a fun time"". I can just boot borderlands 2 if I wanna play a fun looter shooter with punk characters. I bought this game to play the next gen rpg, something that would change the genre. And this was not the case. The game is a lie.

"Short version:The game tries to be Grand Theft Auto: Deus Ex, but kinda fails. As the GTA part feels kind of poorly executed. I picked it up a year later hoping that most bugs would have been dealt with, but I couldn't have been more wrong. Yes, I put a lot of hours in this game already and it is playable if you are willing to reload the game a lot and put up with the bugs. I had to reload a lot of times to get stuff working again or to get unstuck from objects. I am still playing the game to finish it, but I don't recommend it for the €59,99 price tag this still has. Buy it in a sale if you really want it. The amount of bugs makes me not recommend it either.Long version:Like I said it is trying to be a combination between GTA and Deus Ex. The Deus Ex part is where you have a lot of bionic mods which enhance your skills. They boost your skills a little, but you can also do without them. Which is fine. I did like the fact that you could not just mod your character but also your weapons and clothes.The GTA part is where you can steal/buy cars and do missions, or get enough infamy that the police will be chasing you. Vehicle control was kinda wonky for me. Cars and motorcycles bouncing around all over the place. When you are done with the side missions, there isn't really much left to do but to start a new game. The game still needs a lot of polish if you ask me. But I guess it is playable.Pros:- Nice graphics and nice setting.- Main story is nice.- You can choose different kinds of back stories for your character.- Lots of combinations in character creation.- Lots of side missions.- Can mod character equipment and body.Cons:- Full of bugs still (at least for me).- Stealth sucks... it was bugged for me.- Hacking enemies sometimes just feels useless. For example, memory wipe doesn't put enemies out of combat for me, but just acts like reboot optics.- Side missions feel kinda underwhelming. Go there kill enemies and then you are pretty much done most of the times.- Main Story script is sometimes disappointing.- Quests go trough other quests. For example, I was talking to Takemura and got called by Panam during the conversation. Suddenly I was choosing the dialogues for two quests at once.... I tried a reload, but it happened again.....- Vehicle controls are a bit wonky. Speed makes your vehicle bouncy all around the place and steering is just not that great.- Hacking enemies felt kind of useless at times. Only rebooting optics and ping were really usefull imo.Bugs I encountered:- Weapon switching sometimes stopped working. Only a reload could fix it.- Enemies sometimes detect bodies, after I hide them in a container.- I just randomly get detected by enemies while not even moving around and in hiding. No enemies around and no bodies laying around yet. had to reload a lot to just be able to play stealthily.- I just got stuck in objects. This could be a random object, from a table to the computer I am hacking.- Bodies that I place in a container or on the ground suddenly shoot into the air knocking stuff around.- Vehicle call destroys vehicles (yes, I did see it is a beta functionality).- Comparing items after you equip a better one is broken. You have to re-open the inventory to fix this.- Items cannot be picked up, even if they show they can be picked up.- Items get picked up, while trying to interact with quest npc or trying to stealthily kill an enemy. Once i picked up 4 items before I could grab an enemy and it made them almost see me.- Buggy graphics. Look around and you could see vehicles and npcs disappearing or randomly appearing. Sometimes I encountered floating npc. Not sure what is happening there. I got the latest graphic drivers.- The quest tracker is all over the place.- When the relic malfunctions, you get this jittery static effect. This doesn't go away untill I load a save. Is quite annoying.",short versionthe game tries to be grand theft auto deus ex but kinda fails as the gta part feels kind of poorly executed i picked it up a year later hoping that most bugs would

reload but it happened again vehicle controls are a bit wonky speed makes your vehicle bouncy all around the place and steering is just not that great hacking enemies felt kind of useless at times only rebooting optics and ping were really usefull imobugs i encountered weapon switching sometimes stopped working only a reload could fix it enemies sometimes detect bodies after i hide them in a container i just randomly get detected by enemies while not even moving around and in hiding no enemies around and no bodies laying around yet had to reload a lot to just be able to play stealthily i just got stuck in objects this could be a random object from a table to the computer i am hacking bodies that i place in a container or on the ground suddenly shoot into the air knocking stuff around vehicle call destroys vehicles yes i did see it is a beta functionality comparing items after you equip a better one is broken you have to reopen the inventory to fix this items cannot be picked up even if they show they can be picked up items get picked up while trying to interact with quest npc or trying to stealthily kill an enemy once i picked up  items before i could grab an enemy and it made them almost see me buggy graphics look around and you could see vehicles and npcs disappearing or randomly appearing sometimes i encountered floating npc not sure what is happening there i got

"I am someone who first got this game on both Xbox One X and the Playstation 4 Pro. After acquiring both the Xbox Series X and the Playstation 5, I also got my gaming PC which is the MSI GP66 Leopard. This game I have easily over 400 to 500 hours across each platform I own it on and I can say with absolute sincerity and confidence is worth your time and money. While it may have gotten off to a very rough launch when it was first released by CDPR, in it's current state, it's become an absolute blast and joy to play. It is little by little becoming the exact game that we were promised, albeit with a few things still lacking and left to be desired, but that's neither here nor there.

"The whole experience only feels like 20% of a finished game.  Basic gameplay is entertaining enough, but pretty much every feature is extremely minimal in terms of implementation.  Many talents and cyberware items are terribly under-balanced, or else don't seem to work at all.  Monowire is now tied to reflexes/blades, so now Technical Ability AND Cool have no associated arms cyberware.  The Projectile Launch System seems to do nothing whatsoever, as far as I can tell.Attribute points can't be reset in any way (despite a world wherein bodies are practically rebuilt from the ground up on a daily basis) so you end up being locked into a single combat play-style for the entire game.  It gets stale quickly.  Character backgrounds (lifepaths) still don't affect gameplay.You can't preview the appearance (or even stats) of a crafting spec before buying it.  Crafting in general seems poorly designed in a number of ways.  Crafting/upgrading a legendary feels like a complete waist before you reach max level.  And for reference, you can probably finish the game at under half of max level on hard difficulty. The driving mechanics are the worst I've ever experienced in a game.The main story is quite short and offers very little.  The same is true of all character interactions/friendships/relationships.  There are tons of side quests, but they get very repetitive.  All possible endings are needlessly sad/depressing.  Yes, I understand that the game is SUPPOSED to be sad and depressing.  I'm OK with that.  But, it can still be done in a meaningful, satisfying way, which is not the case here.There's more.  Like, a lot more.  SO many different features just feel like a temporary placeholder for a complete, actual mechanic/relationship/story.All of that being said, the game is visually quite impressive.  And *nearly* all of the glitches and bugs from launch seem to be fixed.  The current version (1.5 at time of writing) feels like a beautiful demo of the legendary game that I hope Cyberpunk eventually becomes.  But for now, sadly, there's just very little pay off.",the whole experience only feels like  of a finished game  basic gameplay is entertaining enough but pretty much every feature is extremely minimal in terms of implementation  many talents and cyberware items are terribly underbalanced or else dont seem to work at all  monowire is now tied to reflexesblades so now technical ability and cool have no associated arms cyberware  the projectile launch system seems to do nothing whatsoever as far as i can tellattribute points cant be reset in any way despite a world wherein bodies are practically rebuilt from the ground up on a daily basis so you end up being locked into a single combat playstyle for the entire game  it gets stale quickly  character backgrounds lifepaths still dont affect gameplayyou cant preview the appearance or even stats of a crafting spec before buying it  crafting in general seems poorly designed in a number of ways  craftingupgrading a legendary feels like a complete waist before you reach max level  and for reference you can probably finish the game at under half of max level on hard difficulty the driving mechanics are the worst ive ever experienced in a gamethe main story is quite short and offers very little  the same is true of all character interactionsfriendshipsrelationships  there are tons of side quests but they get very repetitive  all possible endings are needlessly saddepressing  yes i understand that the game is supposed to be sad and depressing  im ok with that  but it can still be done in a meaningful satisfying way which is not the case heretheres more  like a lot more  so many different features just feel like a temporary placeholder for a complete actual mechanicrelationshipstoryall of that being said the game is visually quite impressive  and nearly all of the glitches and bugs from launch seem to be fixed  the current version  at time of writing feels like a beautiful demo of the legendary game that i hope cyberpunk eventually becomes  but for now sadly theres just very little pay off,whole experience feel like finished game basic gameplay entertaining enough pretty much every feature extremely minimal term implementation many talent cyberware item terribly underbalanced else dont seem work monowire tied reflexesblades technical ability cool associated arm cyberware projectile launch system seems nothing whatsoever far tellattribute point cant reset way despite world wherein body practically rebuilt ground daily basis end locked single combat playstyle entire game get stale quickly character background lifepaths still dont affect gameplayyou cant preview appearance even stats crafting spec buying crafting general seems poorly designed number way craftingupgrading legendary feel like complete waist reach max level reference probably finish game half max level hard difficulty driving mechanic worst ive ever experienced gamethe main story quite short offer little true character interactionsfriendshipsrelationships ton side quest get repetitive possible ending needlessly saddepressing yes understand game supposed sad depressing im ok still done meaningful satisfying way case heretheres like lot many different feature feel like temporary placeholder complete actual mechanicrelationshipstoryall said game visually quite impressive nearly glitch bug launch seem fixed current version time writing feel like beautiful demo legendary game hope cyberpunk eventually becomes sadly there little pay,Negative

"Game is playable, story is good, but just too many immersion breaking bugs. In addition, there is one bug to the ""Imagine"" side gig that involves a monk and a BD that crashes and shuts off my pc (happened in my two game playthroughs), which I would consider literally game breaking.As mentioned previously, some immersion breaking bugs are:-Doors not opening-Cars/motorcycle not moving-Can't run/stuck in walking modeThese three were the first to come to mind and the most annoying of the bugs requiring a full restart. There are other bugs that can be annoying too, but at this time I do not recall them.Lastly, not sure if its my cpu (amd) or my 3 year old gpu (amd), but when I start playing the game (at high/ultra settings), I start off with decent fps (~80-90) but after a long session, the frames dip in low range fps (~30-50), which then would require a restart of game to actually go back to the higher frames. Played the game from start to finish one time, and played second play through to about 75%. Both playthroughs are on max difficulty.===============================Played an additional 145 hours (1 whole new playthrough, and another separate save file just to explore) on max difficulty.Based on the hype around the game, it did not meet the hype. A lot of things were cut (you can find them on youtube). But as a buggy mess of a game, it is fun to play through all outcomes (endings). Moreover it was fun to explore using all the known exploits to go out of bounds on the separate save file, without using cheat engines. However, the game becomes stale/boring when there is no longer anything left to do when all side missions are done. I, for one, welcome multiplayer, just so cyberpunk can live on; the dlc will just prolong the end of the game until it eventually becomes stale/boring again. As a comparison to cdpr's previous game the witcher 3, I played through that game completely and love it. However, after all the content (main and dlc) I saw no point in returning to play it. Cyberpunk has to opportunity to stay relevant into the future, but cdpr needs to fix/add so many things that were promised from the advertised version of the game.Finally, from reading other reviews before I even tried this game, to which I paraphrase one reviewer, they said that the true winners of this game are the future buyers of the completed version of the game. Whether those future buyers purchase this game at a discount or not, they will be able to experience a much better playthrough with hopefully current gen graphic cards.",game is playable story is good but just too many immersion breaking bugs in addition there is one bug to the imagine side gig that involves a monk and a bd that crashes and shuts off my pc happened in my two game playthroughs which i would consider literally game breakingas mentioned previously some immersion breaking bugs aredoors not openingcarsmotorcycle not movingcant runstuck in walking modethese three were the first to come to mind and the most annoying of the bugs requiring a full restart there are other bugs that can be annoying too but at this time i do not recall themlastly not sure if its my cpu amd or my  year old gpu amd but when i start playing the game at highultra settings i start off with decent fps  but after a long session the frames dip in low range fps  which then would require a restart of game to actually go back to the higher frames played the game from start to finish one time and played second play through to about  both playthroughs are on max difficultyplayed an additional  hours  whole new playthrough and another separate save file just to explore on max difficultybased on the hype around the game it did not meet the hype a lot of things were cut you can find them on youtube but as a buggy mess of a game it is fun to play through all outcomes endings moreover it was fun to explore using all the known exploits to go out of bounds on the separate save file without using cheat engines however the game becomes staleboring when there is no longer anything left to do when all side missions are done i for one welcome multiplayer just so cyberpunk can live on the dlc will just prolong the end of the game until it eventually becomes staleboring again as a comparison to cdprs previous game the witcher  i played through that game completely and love it however after all the content main and dlc i saw no point in returning to play it cyberpunk has to opportunity to stay relevant into the future but cdpr needs to fixadd so many things that were promised from the advertised version of the gamefinally from reading other reviews before i even tried this game to which i paraphrase one reviewer they said that the true winners of this game are the future buyers of the completed version of the game whether those future buyers purchase this game at a discount or not they will be able to experience a much better playthrough with hopefully current gen graphic cards,game playable story good many immersion breaking bug addition one bug imagine side gig involves monk bd crash shuts pc happened two game playthroughs would consider literally game breakingas mentioned previously immersion breaking bug aredoors openingcarsmotorcycle movingcant runstuck walking modethese three first come mind annoying bug requiring full restart bug annoying time recall themlastly sure cpu amd year old gpu amd start playing game highultra setting start decent fps long session frame dip low range fps would require restart game actually go back higher frame played game start finish one time played second play playthroughs max difficultyplayed additional hour whole new playthrough another separate save file explore max difficultybased hype around game meet hype lot thing cut find youtube buggy mess game fun play outcome ending moreover fun explore using known exploit go bound separate save file without using cheat engine however game becomes staleboring longer anything left side mission done one welcome multiplayer cyberpunk live dlc prolong end game eventually becomes staleboring comparison cdprs previous game witcher played game completely love however content main dlc saw point returning play cyberpunk opportunity stay relevant future cdpr need fixadd many thing promised advertised version gamefinally reading review even tried game paraphrase one reviewer said true winner game future buyer completed version game whether future buyer purchase game discount able experience much better playthrough hopefully current gen graphic card,Negative
"I'm running a 3080 card, and I will admit that - when they're not bugging out - the graphics are immersive and pretty. But NPCs float all over the place like they've all learnt how to do the Moonwalk. The main story is really unengaging, and because none of the characters - not even yourself - have any likeable characteristics, you just don't give a ???? what happens to them. I spent most of the time fast-forwarding through the garbage the Keanu Reeves character was talking about because I just didn't like him.Get it on sale - like I did - and you might spend a few hours trogging through the uninspired, garbage plot before you realize that, ultimately, the woke landscape and characters - who seem to be either cross-dressers or gay (not that there's anything wrong with that, but there are actually straight people in the world who wear clothes according to their gender) - just aren't worth the effort.

"I didn't have many major technical issues like some people did. I had 1 or 2 incidents where i had to reboot the game because of texture loss issues, but other than that nothing too bad. I have mixed feelings on the game-play. I would consider the driving to be mediocre at best. I was a bit disappointed that you cant customize cars as well but not a huge deal. The melee combat is atrocious. It just doesn't feel right, like it never left its alpha phase or something. The gun-play is actually pretty good. Probably one of the stronger aspects of the game.  In all, that stuff together isnt good but isnt deal breaking for me. What is deal breaking for me is the story. In my mind it is unquestionably the weakest part of the game. Absolutely pathetic. The very first main mission you do is the only part of the story that matters. The rest is basically glorified side content. It feels like a game that came out on Xbox 360 but with pretty graphics. Also, I know steam says I played this game for 165 hours. I haven't. I just fell asleep while playing it multiple times. That is not a joke.

"TL;DR: The game is a buggy mess, but it meets and sometimes exceeds my expectations for story, characters, and world building and I have had a wonderful time playing it.Yes, the game is buggy. Yes, there are some frustrating mechanics. Yes, the game is basically a full priced early alpha game. HOWEVER!I absolutely love this game. It fulfills my open world desires and adds in some interesting combat and stealth mechanics. Riding around the city with an NPC driving or driving myself is so much fun. It brings together a lot of what I liked of the mechanics in GTA5 and the post-apocalyptic theme I have come to love from games like the Fallout series. I have really enjoyed the character development from main allies to smaller side quest characters. The world really feels alive, for the most part.I have played exclusively on my laptop so far (i5-8300H, mobile GTX 1050 Ti, 16GB RAM, and loading from a Firecuda SSHD) and have no complaints on performance. Textures sometimes load in a little weird, but that's something I expect with my setup.To sum it up, I really enjoy this game despite (and sometimes because of) the bugs that exist. The story and the world are so enjoyable to me that I am more than willing to look past the deficiencies and enjoy immersing myself in the technological future of the game.",tldr the game is a buggy mess but it meets and sometimes exceeds my expectations for story characters and world building and i have had a wonderful time playing ityes the game is buggy yes there are some frustrating mechanics yes the game is basically a full priced early alpha game howeveri absolutely love this game it fulfills my open world desires and adds in some interesting combat and stealth mechanics riding around the city with an npc driving or driving myself is so much fun it brings together a lot of what i liked of the mechanics in gta and the postapocalyptic theme i have come to love from games like the fallout series i have really enjoyed the character development from main allies to smaller side quest characters the world really feels alive for the most parti have played exclusively on my laptop so far ih mobile gtx  ti gb ram and loading from a firecuda sshd and have no complaints on performance textures sometimes load in a little weird but thats something i expect with my setupto sum it up i really enjoy this game despite and sometimes because of the bugs that exist the story and the world are so enjoyable to me that i am more than willing to look past the deficiencies and enjoy immersing myself in the technological future of the game,tldr game buggy mess meet sometimes exceeds expectation story character world building wonderful time playing ityes game buggy yes frustrating mechanic yes game basically full priced early alpha game howeveri absolutely love game fulfills open world desire add interesting combat stealth mechanic riding around city npc driving driving much fun brings together lot liked mechanic gta postapocalyptic theme come love game like fallout series really enjoyed character development main ally smaller side quest character world really feel alive parti played exclusively laptop far ih mobile gtx ti gb ram loading firecuda sshd complaint performance texture sometimes load little weird thats something expect setupto sum really enjoy game despite sometimes bug exist story world enjoyable willing look past deficiency enjoy immersing technological future game,Positive

"While I recommend this game I would not recommend it for full price.I went into this game knowing that it had issues on the technical side and, yes, they are there. By now they're mostly fixed, but the bugs were kinda annoying. Though not as much as I had with the story. While I ultimately enjoyed the story, I don't like how, inevitably, every life path becomes the same one eventually, and more or less amounts to 5 minutes of introductory gameplay and some different dialogue options. It's a very linear campaign and roleplaying a character like advertised is essentially impossible. Like it or not, you are V, and there isn't much variation. Replayability is only useful if you want to try different perk builds.But being V isn't too bad. Combat is decent, and the setting is amazing. That's saving it for me. I wish there were more side quests, and that the side quests were more than your typical fetch quests. On that note, it feels kinda like half a game, and that you can tell there was so much more planned, like more vendors, more quests, factions, etc etc. I wish that game was released instead of this one. Still, I recommend if you want to spend 100+ hours merking gonks like I did.",while i recommend this game i would not recommend it for full pricei went into this game knowing that it had issues on the technical side and yes they are there by now theyre mostly fixed but the bugs were kinda annoying though not as much as i had with the story while i ultimately enjoyed the story i dont like how inevitably every life path becomes the same one eventually and more or less amounts to  minutes of introductory gameplay and some different dialogue options its a very linear campaign and roleplaying a character like advertised is essentially impossible like it or not you are v and there isnt much variation replayability is only useful if you want to try different perk buildsbut being v isnt too bad combat is decent and the setting is amazing thats saving it for me i wish there were more side quests and that the side quests were more than your typical fetch quests on that note it feels kinda like half a game and that you can tell there was so much more planned like more vendors more quests factions etc etc i wish that game was released instead of this one still i recommend if you want to spend  hours merking gonks like i did,recommend game would recommend full pricei went game knowing issue technical side yes theyre mostly fixed bug kinda annoying though much story ultimately enjoyed story dont like inevitably every life path becomes one eventually le amount minute introductory gameplay different dialogue option linear campaign roleplaying character like advertised essentially impossible like v isnt much variation replayability useful want try different perk buildsbut v isnt bad combat decent setting amazing thats saving wish side quest side quest typical fetch quest note feel kinda like half game tell much planned like vendor quest faction etc etc wish game released instead one still recommend want spend hour merking gonks like,Positive
"Only ran into one T pose and a character drinking with no glass in hand. Other than that, the game is great. The shining light is the story but more importantly the side characters.

"Dreadful. Bugs aside, it has bullet spongy and unsatisfying gunplay where there's only one build option (it's crit damage+chance), a world that loves telling you how dangerous it is than it actually being that unless you accidentally wonder into an area that is too high level while there's no way to tell an area is too high level until you get oneshot by a mook in it, a story that doesn't give you any options but literally lets you pick which ending you want at the end like they saw Mass Effect 3 and thought that the only thing worth incorporating from an actually good RPG shooter is the part that everyone hated as they sure didn't add the interesting and important dialogue options as there is next to none, especially in the first 20 hours, but in those first 20 hours they do love shoving random characters in your face that they don't explain every 5 minutes who just call you on the phone and expect you to do seemingly randomly generated dull missions for them, crammed in crafting that only exists to give the Technical Ability skill a use while the Technical Ability skill only exists because they felt like they have to, which also goes for the Cool stat. Pro tip, the maximum stat Cool has to be to pass EVERY SINGLE COOL STAT CHECK IN THE GAME is 8. Get to 8 and you get to see all 6 of the times that it comes in handy. For being an Role Playing Game, you don't really get to do a whole of Role Playing, as you play as V, a generic wannabe badass that ""technically"" has 3 different backgrounds that give you a different intro mission and then makes 0 difference past that point. The Corpo background is especially interesting in that it's the only one that they didn't bother writing an intro mission for and instead you talk to a guy, go to a place, talk to another guy and you get spit out in the same place the other 2 place you. If you decide to take a break from side quests for 3 seconds and do the main quest, you'll quickly run into the final mission where it tells you that if you keep playing, you won't be able to do anything else so you can spend another 20 hours doing side quests that lead into side quests that lead into side quests that lead into side quests. I have more problems, like the vehicle economy, cyberware trivializing stealth completely and crafting being useless when making weapons and armor and beyond busted when you find out you can just pump out armor mods for a handful of pocket lint and a paper clip that give more armor than your entire armor set put together. They designed a super pretty world and then just gave up on the rest of the game. Maybe turning into a hollow GTA Online clone would work for it, because then there'd be a reason to care about the world instead of running through it to get from one side mission to another. Maybe you could be bothered to use anything other than the best vehicle in the game that they hand you at the beginning of the game. But whatever, hype hype hype CD Projekt Red could set an orphanage on fire and they'd still be seen as the saviours of humanity and curers of cancer and solvers of world hunger.",dreadful bugs aside

"I sunk 8 hours into this game in the first day alone.  Played some of the main story line and played some of the side quests.  Actually did quit a bit and tried a bunch of different techniques from full all out running and gunning, to sneaking, to sniping.  Decided to write a review based upon what I've experienced so far.Pros:*The graphics are great (RTX 2080) and it's one of the better games I've seen for graphics.  Wish I had a 3090 for DSSL and Rays.  Dreams.....*The story line is actually really good and I found I'm following it more than most games.*The RPG aspect of the game is really nice and lets you customize your character based upon the type of character you want to play.  I'm used to fantasy games but found I really am liking the tech trees.Cons:*Bugs galore!  I was hoping with the game being pushed back so much the bugs would mostly be gone.  But no.  I'm talking glitches and you are seeing items floating in mid air while the item has moved (and you can still see it moving, like the chop sticks Jackie has in the beginning after your apartment). (Two screenshots on my profile)*Slow.  This game at times runs very slow.  I found reloading the game helped with that.  Not sure if it's so many people playing it, the internet connection (highly doubtful since a reload fixed it), or just another bug.*The edges are blurry on the game.  I use a 55"" OLED UHD (LG) TV and to see that it's rather disappointing.  Most of the time I can miss it by focusing on the middle of the screen, but other times it is painfully obvious.  (Screenshot on my page).*Bugs (again).  It is almost like they didn't put this game through testers before it came out and they just pushed it out in order to make the fans happy.Overall I say this game needs to go back and be worked on for another 2 - 4 weeks to work the bugs out.  It really is ruining the game.  My PC exceeds all the requirements for Ultra, and the only thing I can't match is the new graphics card (nVidia 3090).  Aside from that my machine is able to work through all of this easily.  If you can push through the bugs the game is really good.  I'm hoping in a patch or two they will work out the kinks and things will be fine.  Maybe at that point I'll change my review to a ""Yes.""  Until then I have to say no as it feels like this game was rushed, even though they sent out a message saying they were pushing back the game for quality checks and to not rush it.  I really want this game to be just as awesome as Witcher 3.

"READ THIS IF YOU WATCHED THE ANIME ON NETFLIX FIRST Alright, Choom. Hear me out. I do not recommend this game at full price. Get it on sale. Even in 2023.Initially, I avoided this game because of how many people were having issues at launch, but the Netflix show got me interested in the lore. I mean, the idea is preem, and the gameplay elements are really nova...but only if they work.So far, I've encountered a few bugs that kill the fun:1. Somehow, the whole city got flagged as a safe zone and I could not draw my weapons. Imagine going into combat without being able to pull out a weapon. I'm not here to play a pacifist route. Had to load an old save file back before this bug happened, and it was disappointing to have to do it all again. This only happened one time, so far.2. There is an XP bonus that you get from sleeping for 24h in your apartment. I try to have it on at all times, but whenever I pick up any skill shards that level up my skills, it will remove the buff. That means I have to find a fast travel to go back to my apartment, reapply all buffs because the 24h period will remove them, and then go back to what I was doing. This happens every single time I pick up a skill shard.3. If you're a fan of the anime on Netflix, then you'll most definitely want to try out the Sandevistan. It is literally the core element of how I chose play the game, because I want to slow down time and kill enemies before they even have a chance to react to me. Unfortunately, it is a frequent occurrence that I am unable to activate it until I am under enemy fire or take damage. What the hell is even the point of being a cyborg ninja if I cannot have the element of surprise. It's been about a 50/50 and seems to occur more frequently after I've been driving.4. Somehow while doing a side mission (NCPD scanner), I completed the objective, but it didn't register it as completed. I am somewhat of a completionist, and it was a bit irritating to see it continue to show on my map. It has only happened one time, so far.5. I'm absolutely certain that there will be another bug here, eventually. It just hasn't happened yet.TL;DR - Get it on sale. It's still buggy, and you should save that $30 towards Pokemon S/V.",read this if you watched the anime on netflix first alright choom hear me out i do not recommend this game at full price get it on sale even in initially i avoided this game because of how many people were having issues at launch but the netflix show got me interested in the lore i mean the idea is preem and the gameplay elements are really novabut only if they workso far ive encountered a few bugs that kill the fun somehow the whole city got flagged as a safe zone and i could not draw my weapons imagine going into combat without being able to pull out a weapon im not here to play a pacifist route had to load an old save file back before this bug happened and it was disappointing to have to do it all again this only happened one time so far there is an xp bonus that you get from sleeping for h in your apartment i try to have it on at all times but whenever i pick up any skill shards that level up my skills it will remove the buff that means i have to find a fast travel to go back to my apartment reapply all buffs because the h period will remove them and then go back to what i was doing this happens every single time i pick up a skill shard if youre a fan of the anime on netflix then youll most definitely want to try out the sandevistan it is literally the core element of how i chose play the game because i want to slow down time and kill enemies before they even have a chance to react to me unfortunately it is a frequent occurrence that i am unable to activate it until i am under enemy fire or take damage what the hell is even the point of being a cyborg ninja if i cannot have the element of surprise its been about a  and seems to occur more frequently after ive been driving somehow while doing a side mission ncpd scanner i completed the objective but it didnt register it as completed i am somewhat of a completionist and it was a bit irritating to see it continue to show on my map it has only happened one time so far im absolutely certain that there will be another bug here eventually it just hasnt happened yettldr  get it on sale its still buggy and you should save that  towards pokemon sv,read watched anime netflix first alright choom hear recommend game full price get sale even initially avoided game many people issue launch netflix show got interested lore mean idea preem gameplay element really novabut workso far ive encountered bug kill fun somehow whole city got flagged safe zone could draw weapon imagine going combat without able pull weapon im play pacifist route load old save file back bug happened disappointing happened one time far xp bonus get sleeping h apartment try time whenever pick skill shard level skill remove buff mean find fast travel go back apartment reapply buff h period remove go back happens every single time pick skill shard youre fan anime netflix youll definitely want try sandevistan literally core element chose play game want slow time kill enemy even chance react unfortunately frequent occurrence unable activate enemy fire take damage hell even point cyborg ninja element surprise seems occur frequently ive driving somehow side mission ncpd scanner completed objective didnt register completed somewhat completionist bit irritating see continue show map happened one time far im absolutely certain another bug eventually hasnt happened yettldr get sale still buggy save towards pokemon sv,Negative

"Game is an unfinished cash grab that feels like an early access game and not a 60 dollar release.*GLITCHES*Glitches I encountered while playing:-The cop cars teleporting through the ceiling during the first encounter with Jackie.-Picking up unconscious enemies and dropping them can sometimes cause them to explode (literally) and die.-Enemies doubling up on benches (sitting in the same seat clipping into each other).-T-Posing NPCs-If you sprint across ramps you can accelerate to shadow the hedgehog levels of speed. This can, of course, happen unintentionally.-There's a spot in the game where cars ram into a guard rail of the freeway continually. I checked with my friend if it was in his game too. It was.*GAMEPLAY*-Enemies are way too tanky and you're never really aware of how much damage you're going to do. Guns seem to either one shot enemies or do minimal damage.-Movement feels like I'm playing a unity game.-The stealth is shallow, and consists of walking up behind someone and pressing F.-There's one hacking minigame that you play over and over again, hacking has little utility aside from distracting enemies.-Enemy AI is nonexistent, the most they do is take cover and lob grenades.-Driving is abysmal, often times not matching the players inputs. Trying to drive 5 feet without murdering someone is impossible.-The crime system is nonsensical, and cops have the ability to teleport to your location.*WORLD*-AI do not respond to their environment in any significant way.-Nothing to do outside of short side quests.-Random encounters consist of shooting a bunch of enemies.-Very few buildings to enter and explore.-Venders all serve the basically the same items.-No mini-games, despite tons of opportunity to implement them.-Fast traveling is too convenient, no use in travelling by car.*ATMOSPHERE*Two things I really hate:1. This whole game world feels ""mature"" in the way 14 year olds think about the word. Here's a bunch of sex toys, are you laughing? Here's a caricature of a gay man, isn't he weird? Wow you get to customize your junk?! Wow lol that's so edgy. The whole game just has this undercurrent of lame humor that cuts straight through the immersion at certain points. According to the marketing, this is supposed to be a gritty dark game that you're excepted to take seriously while also having billboards on every wall with people eating bunghole.2. This game has no identity, ripping off elements from much better cyberpunk worlds and cobbling them together. When you watch Bladerunner, it feels like Bladerunner. When you play Deus Ex, it feels like Deus Ex. When you read a book like Neuromancer or Snow Crash, it feels like those books. When you play Cyberpunk 2077? It's that type of experience where you go ""Ah, I get that reference"" or ""Ah, yeah that's like that one thing from-"". Not once in my playtime did I feel like I was experiencing something I hadn't seen 100 times before. Absolutely soulless.Don't spend 60 dollars on this game, and definitely don't hold out hope that this game will be fixed in the future.

"bad game. no bueno.GTAV is 7 years old and it beats this game in every possible aspect. if GTAV released in 2020 and Cyberpunk released in 2013, that would make *much* more sense.bugs, lack of depth, and disappointing gameplay mean i always come away from the game frustrated. i've only sunk a lot of hours into it because i was invested in it being good. i wanted to like it. example: there's a series of missions where you have to find self-driving cars that are roaming around. the mission doesn't give you any further details, except for - calling your phone every time you are close to a car. which is, so many times, that it ?????? up multiple stealth segments where I was trying to stealth kill someone, and the button was unavailable because i was on a phone call (WHICH I COULD NOT REJECT, TRIED THAT). when i relented and started one of the car missions, the car i was tailing became aggressive and started *directly* quoting GLaDOS lines from portal from me, with little context. just, the audio lines, lifted and slotted in. like the, ""you're a horrible person. we didn't even test for that."" YOU NEVER TESTED ME FAM, BUT THAT'S ALL GOOD FAM. this might've been fun, if i wasn't already frustrated with the game in general. anyway, i had to weaken(?) the car, and since i was on a motorcycle, i couldn't weaken it by crashing into it. instead, i waited for the car AI to glitch out and stand still, then i beat it with my fists for a few minutes, until it exploded and killed me. reloaded, did that all again, ran away from the explosion, and completed the mission (confirmed, received money). i then IMMEDIATELY received a call saying that i had damaged the car too much, and straight up *failed* the other eight separate missions in an instant. the most damning thing i can say? my reaction wasn't anger. it was, ""thank ??????? christ i never have to touch those missions again.""???? stupid game",bad game no buenogtav is  years old and it beats this game in every possible aspect if gtav released in  and cyberpunk released in  that would make much more sensebugs lack of depth and disappointing gameplay mean i always come away from the game frustrated ive only sunk a lot of hours into it because i was invested in it being good i wanted to like it example theres a series of missions where you have to find selfdriving cars that are roaming around the mission doesnt give you any further details except for  calling your phone every time you are close to a car which is so many times that it  up multiple stealth segments where i was trying to stealth kill someone and the button was unavailable because i was on a phone call which i could not reject tried that when i relented and started one of the car missions the car i was tailing became aggressive and started directly quoting glados lines from portal from me with little context just the audio lines lifted and slotted in like the youre a horrible person we didnt even test for that you never tested me fam but thats all good fam this mightve been fun if i wasnt already frustrated with the game in general anyway i had to weaken the car and since i was on a motorcycle i couldnt weaken it by crashing into it instead i waited for the car ai to glitch out and stand still then i beat it with my fists for a few minutes until it exploded and killed me reloaded did that all again ran away from the explosion and completed the mission confirmed received money i then immediately received a call saying that i had damaged the car too much and straight up failed the other eight separate missions in an instant the most damning thing i can say my reaction wasnt anger it was thank  christ i never have to touch those missions again stupid game,bad game buenogtav year old beat game every possible aspect gtav released cyberpunk released would make much sensebugs lack depth disappointing gameplay mean always come away game frustrated ive sunk lot hour invested good wanted like example there series mission find selfdriving car roaming around mission doesnt give detail except calling phone every time close car many time multiple stealth segment trying stealth kill someone button unavailable phone call could reject tried relented started one car mission car tailing became aggressive started directly quoting glados line portal little context audio line lifted slotted like youre horrible person didnt even test never tested fam thats good fam mightve fun wasnt already frustrated game general anyway weaken car since motorcycle couldnt weaken crashing instead waited car ai glitch stand still beat fist minute exploded killed reloaded ran away explosion completed mission confirmed received money immediately received call saying damaged car much straight failed eight separate mission instant damning thing say reaction wasnt anger thank christ never touch mission stupid game,Negative

"Cyberpunk 2077 is an excellent game. This is a comment that would be seen with mockery and disbelief after what was admittingly possibly the worst launch of any game ever (until BF2042 that is). The damage may already be done, this game might not be saved but 10 years from now I can see this being highly regarded as a cult classic and the talk of a disastrous launch will slowly taper away.  To paraphrase a now famous youtube video this game overpromised and underdelivered. The key to enjoying this game is to appreciated it for what it is and not hate it for what it is not, if this was 15 years ago cyberpunk would be on the cover of every gaming magazine and labelled as a GTA killer. I do believe the general public saw this game as a new evolution of open world gaming with multiple intrinsic systems, deep customisation and many many dynamic open world events (think Red Dead Redemption 2) that would make night city feel like a never ending living breathing world, what we got was essentially a Deus Ex/Mass Effect hybrid with an open world not dissimilar to a Ubisoft game and all the bugs and glitches of a Bethesda game.    To talk personally I bought this game on my PS5 but was not massively swayed by the hype. What I was greeted with when I first booted up the game was something that looked worse than a switch game, I then refunded the game and bought it on PC only to find my RX 580 was incapable of getting the best out of the game, rather than refund I shelved it for another day, a few years late I came back. Cons - Weak loot system akin to Borderlands, the game has unique weapons and armour but also has tiered loot which bogs your inventory down with stat sticks.Bugs and glitches still present however my experience with them was minimal.Gigs (type of side quest) are very repetitive and are very similar to the fluff found in most open world games.The games open world is just set dressing albeit a very pretty one, you won't find any organic encounters in the open world, all the cool stuff is limited to side quests.   customisation of character appearance on surface looks cool but is quite limited, clothes also come with an armour rating which can impact fashion, if you want the best stats you usual ended up looking like you've been dumpster diving. I don't like male V's voice. Pros - The story is actually really interesting with lots of cool twist and turns, the game has multiple endings and I found all of them to be very profound and some were quite thought provoking. The stories of all the characters you meet on your journey are all very compelling. The characters are the stars of the show, they are all so richly complex with individual motives, goals, opinions and fears. They all feel like real people who have all been burned by night city at one point. My favourite part of the game was getting to know these characters more, whether it be the arguing between Panam and Saul over how the Aldecaldos should be run. Making a budding friendship with River Ward after experience some disturbing circumstances together or just playing a gig with old friends. These moments are what elevate this game from standard open world guff into something special. Johnny Silverhand. He get's his own pro spot because Keanu Reeves brings so much life to this character, what I was expecting to be a phoned in performance from an actor who didn't care was actually in fact one of the best and most tragic character arcs I've seen in a game recently. Without spoilers the journey this character goes on is a story of revenge, maturity and tragedy and it is way better than it has any right to be. The city. It may just be set dressing but it is the best set dressing I have seen in a long time. The attention to detail is so incredible you cannot help being sucked into this world, the constant advertising, news reports and police presence in this shiny futuristic world is a mirror to our own reality and you cannot help but be completed immersed in this world. What truly makes this shine is how claustrophobic the city feels, it's almost like you are being suffocated by the sheer magnitude and weight of the sins of the city, and it's awesome. Combat is punchy and satisfying and whilst it might not be very deep you can build a number of different characters, I had a male V proficient in katanas and bleed (too much Elden Ring) but was also a dab hand at hacking, but then I also had a stealth pistol build for a female V. In short the game gives you so many ways to approach a situation it feels like some of the best immersive sim games. Do you level up body and use strength to rip open doors and smash through soldiers, or do you use your tech abilities to open hatches and utilise stealth, the game openly encourages exploration of the combat mechanics and that isn't even taking into account cyber upgrades (double jump and mantis blades are still a must). The OST slaps harder than when I slapped Kerry on the boat. Should be amongst the best and should be a part of any conversation when discussing music in games, it's that's good. You like Doom Eternal's music? imagine that with more synth. Conclusion -  In short I could go on and on about the charters and the world building, this game was clearly crafted with love and if you are curious now is the best time to play. Just make sure you have a capable rig. Without a doubt if you like games like skyrim, fallout, deus ex, system shock, bioshock, mass effect, prey or even the witcher games you cannot do much wrong by giving this game a look. Ignore the hate and get playing, you won't be disappointed samurai.",cyberpunk  is an excellent game this is a comment that would be seen with mockery and disbelief after what was admittingly possibly

"Good environment riddled with bugs, poor story choices, mediocre game play and tedious/repetitious quests. The itemization is bland with no creativity. Items don't have any impact on gameplay mechanics and are mostly raw stat boosts. The crafting system in the game is very tedious and nearly worthless. Quests don't scale with player level so by the time you reach level 25-30 every quest on the map will be too easy to pose a challenge. The main quest is short and the premier side quests are hidden and difficult to find without looking at third party information.

"Coming in from the Witcher 3, and as a major RPG fan, I had extremely high hopes for CDPR.  ...and I wasn't disappointed. I have had very minor bugs, and the only gripe I have with the game is the AI of the police. They typically have no logic behind their spawning, they simply appear behind you and TKO you within seconds.  The world building, the atmosphere, the immersion, the characters and storylines everyone has, and the overall impact you have on how the story plays out are all huge features of the game, after spending nearly 60 hours completing the quest and the vast majority of the side content. The ending was phenomenal, the combat was definitely ""enough"". If you were a fan of Deus Ex or Borderlands, the gunplay should be reminiscent of those.  All in all, Cyberpunk isn't perfect.

Wait to buy this until January when performance and bug fixes are done. 9/10",coming in from the witcher  and as a major rpg fan i had extremely high hopes for cdpr  and i wasnt disappointed i have had very minor bugs and the only gripe i have with the game is the ai of the police they typically have no logic behind their spawning they simply appear behind you and tko you within seconds  the world building the atmosphere the immersion the characters and storylines everyone has and the overall impact you have on how the story plays out are all huge features of the game after spending nearly  hours completing the quest and the vast majority of the side content the ending was phenomenal the combat was definitely enough if you were a fan of deus ex or borderlands the gunplay should be reminiscent of those  all in all cyberpunk isnt perfect it absolutely isnt but the story really makes you feel invested interested and most importantly the story takes you for a ride anger happiness sadness melancholy excitement i would highly recommend this game to fans of the rpg genre and i would recommend this game to scifi genre fans as well  wait to buy this until january when performance and bug fixes are done,coming witcher major rpg fan extremely high hope cdpr wasnt disappointed minor bug gripe game ai police typically logic behind spawning simply appear behind tko within second world building atmosphere immersion character storyline everyone overall impact story play huge feature game spending nearly hour completing quest vast majority side content ending phenomenal combat definitely enough fan deus ex borderland gunplay reminiscent cyberpunk isnt perfect absolutely isnt story really make feel invested interested importantly story take ride anger happiness sadness melancholy excitement would highly recommend game fan rpg genre would recommend game scifi genre fan well wait buy january performance bug fix done,Positive
"Came back after two years from release to see if they've improved the game... They did not.Game is still riddled with terrible game play issues that shouldn't have taken two years to fix. At this point you have to conclude that they just don't care or think they are acceptable designs.For example it's nearly impossible to sprint longer than 10 seconds. For some reason if you try to go up/down curbs or small obstacles while sprinting it stop you from sprinting. You then have to run for a couple seconds to get back to sprinting. This happens constantly.Also the UI is still awful. It was clearly designed for consoles and it's horrible to use on a PC. Inventory management is such a pain I just stopped picking things up halfway through the game. Not only was it pointless from a resource standpoint it was such a slow and tedious process to sell or deconstruct all the useless items that flood your inventory. At one point I saw I had over 100 food items in my inventory so I went to a vendor to sell them. Should be easy right? WRONG. I have to select the item THEN it brings up a second menu which then asks how many I want to sell to which I then have to click and drag/slide a bar all the way over sell the whole stack of items. This operation takes 5-10 seconds just with the loading and dragging. They are also a pain to use requiring you to go into your inventory then into a second inventory then sorting through a huge list of crap because there's 50 different types of drink items that all do the same thing, but they are mixed in with the 50 different types of food items that all do the same thing which are ALSO mixed in with 50 different liquors which all do the same thing. To top it all off all of them are useless and the effects they give you don't last long enough or aren't potent enough to warrant giving them a second glance.I could go on and on about all these types small problems that are all over the place, but I'm going stop here as I don't want to write a 5 page review. Just know that there are small problems like these all throughout the game.Ultimately the world they built is great, but the game play falls way into the sub par category with frustrating and tedious mechanics.

"A lot has been said about the bugs in this game, and yes it has a lot of bugs, but mostly dumb graphical ones that don't spoil the game and are actually very funny. The AI is also not that hot, the police will chase you on foot for a block and then give up, so just get a car and drive 2 blocks and you are safe. There are many things like this that needs work and I am sure they will improve on them. But this game is really a lot of fun, exploring and finding new things, so many missions, I have almost played 100 hours at the time of writing this and I haven't finished the game yet. I do plan on finishing it soon, I am on the last mission, but I am trying not to do it until I really have to. But I am running out of side missions to do. This game is crying out for multiple play throughs too. The best thing about it is the look though. The ""cyberpunk"" style. Now I am lucky enough to be able to play this on 4K with all the graphics turned up to max and with all the ray tracing goodness thrown in too. It is the best looking game I have ever played. The story is also amazing too, each mission is fun, but the main story is really great and heartbreaking at times. I know there are multiple endings to this and I will try to see them all. If you have the money and the machine to play this on high settings, then this game is a must. But even if you don't and have one of the new consoles, it is also going to look great on that too. If you have an old console, I wouldn't bother though, a lot has been said about that. 9/10 game for me!!!",a lot has been said about the bugs in this game and yes it has a lot of bugs but mostly dumb graphical ones that dont spoil the game and are actually very funny the ai is also not that hot the police will chase you on foot for a block and then give up so just get a car and drive  blocks and you are safe there are many things like this that needs work and i am sure they will improve on them but this game is really a lot of fun exploring and finding new things so many missions i have almost played  hours at the time of writing this and i havent finished the game yet i do plan on finishing it soon i am on the last mission but i am trying not to do it until i really have to but i am running out of side missions to do this game is crying out for multiple play throughs too the best thing about it is the look though the cyberpunk style now i am lucky enough to be able to play this on k with all the graphics turned up to max and with all the ray tracing goodness thrown in too it is the best looking game i have ever played the story is also amazing too each mission is fun but the main story is really great and heartbreaking at times i know there are multiple endings to this and i will try to see them all if you have the money and the machine to play this on high settings then this game is a must but even if you dont and have one of the new consoles it is also going to look great on that too if you have an old console i wouldnt bother though a lot has been said about that  game for me,lot said bug game yes lot bug mostly dumb graphical one dont spoil game actually funny ai also hot police chase foot block give get car drive block safe many thing like need work sure improve game really lot fun exploring finding new thing many mission almost played hour time writing havent finished game yet plan finishing soon last mission trying really running side mission game cry multiple play throughs best thing look though cyberpunk style lucky enough able play k graphic turned max ray tracing goodness thrown best looking game ever played story also amazing mission fun main story really great heartbreaking time know multiple ending try see money machine play high setting game must even dont one new console also going look great old console wouldnt bother though lot said game,Positive

"Cyberpunk is amazing when you take it for what it is. Its combat and stealth mechanics are basic but enjoyable. Its driving mechanics are decent at best ( all we ask for is a zoomed out mini map ). The crafting system could be better. When you immerse yourself in the world and its characters, sit through the extra dialogue and read through the various text logs found throughout Night City, you can tell that there's a lot of passion put into this game. It has so much to offer. But that doesn't excuse its downsides. The buggy AI, the major and minor bugs that are in the game, and the feeling that the game feels unfinished makes it fall short of becoming a phenomenal game. Combined with the over hyping and misleading marketing, with all the advertisement for the game on consoles that can't run it optimally and the trailers making it seem like a pure action game rather than an Action RPG with a plethora of dialogue and text logs, similar to games from the Deus Ex series, Cyberpunk 2077 unfortunately was doomed from the start and the hype train came to an abrupt stop when it didn't meet a lot of people's expectations. Only time will tell what will become of this game in the future. Either CD will pull through and deliver or cover Cyberpunk 2077 in band-aids over time and call it a day. I hope for the former.TLDR: Game is good and enjoyable if you can laugh off T-posing and flying cars but desperately needs work to reach its full potential. P.S. Optimization seems to be a case by case basis.

"I made the absolute dreadful mistake of trying this on a freakin' xbox first.

Still has it's issues, but it's so much more enjoyable. Combat isn't bad, actually. Hacking is fun. To be completely honest with you, and I know it's a crappy thing to say, but it reminds me of Watchdogs. No one wants to hear that comparison, I know. Lay off. However, it's the truth. All that BS aside, it's fun and it looks great on my PC. Last gen XT 5700 and it's running just fine. I'm not too far into the story simply because i enjoy doing the little tasks first so I can explore the city. But I played far enough into it on xbox to know the main premise. I like Jackie. He's cool as hell. Funny, too. Anyway, I'm pleased with it. Does it break new ground? IDK. Prolly not. But that's not what I was looking for. Just wanted a cyberpunk world to get lost in for 40-80 hours, which is what I expect. I set the combat to extra-hard so it'll slow me down. That's it. I'm happy with it.

Story/character progression is way too quick, substance of the main storyline is lacking, graphics are good, and if you are a completionist the open world has a lot of content, albeit a lot of repeat activities.",it was a huge letdown on release with all the bugs and lack of content so my review will be eternally negativedont pick it up unless its on sale storycharacter progression is way too quick substance of the main storyline is lacking graphics are good and if you are a completionist the open world has a lot of content albeit a lot of repeat activities,huge letdown release bug lack content review eternally negativedont pick unless sale storycharacter progression way quick substance main storyline lacking graphic good completionist open world lot content albeit lot repeat activity,Negative

"64 hours and i can confirm its worth the money, but i will say the experience would have been better if i waited until more bugs were fixed, that being said the story is still amazing and cdpr sure does know how to set the tone when it comes to the story. Even with the bugs i would give it an 8/10, but be warned this game is not optimized well so if you have an entry line GPU like mine which is a 1650 super, i recommend you just bite the bullet and play on low.",hours and i can confirm its worth the money but i will say the experience would have been better if i waited until more bugs were fixed that being said the story is still amazing and cdpr sure does know how to set the tone when it comes to the story even with the bugs i would give it an  but be warned this game is not optimized well so if you have an entry line gpu like mine which is a  super i recommend you just bite the bullet and play on low,hour confirm worth money say experience would better waited bug fixed said story still amazing cdpr sure know set tone come story even bug would give warned game optimized well entry line gpu like mine super recommend bite bullet play low,Positive
"This game issnt anywhere near ready for release yet. Buggy textures, broken animations and features and an overall lack of optimization combined with the absolutely terrible AI leads to unenjoyable and umimmersive gamplay. I really hope they fix these issues soon, as i was really looking forward to its release. At least it looks good....",this game issnt anywhere near ready for release yet buggy textures broken animations and features and an overall lack of optimization combined with the absolutely terrible ai leads to unenjoyable and umimmersive gamplay i really hope they fix these issues soon as i was really looking forward to its release at least it looks good,game issnt anywhere near ready release yet buggy texture broken animation feature overall lack optimization combined absolutely terrible ai lead unenjoyable umimmersive gamplay really hope fix issue soon really looking forward release least look good,Negative

"I have a pretty beefy PC, and the highest fps I can get without sacrificing game experience is 60 fps. Which is playable for sure, but not the 150-170 fps I'm accustomed to getting in other games I play. It's a huge world and so much to do. There seems to be a lot of room for character growth which enhances the longevity of each play through if you're the ""stop and smell the roses"" kinda gamer. I also like how stress-free it is on the easy level. It allows a wide variety of people and skill sets to enjoy the game, or those of us who are slow to adapt to a whole new set of keys and aim style. Yeah it's a little buggy at times but nothing that keeps you from moving forward. I wish that we could see our character more often in dialogue and stuff but I know that would have been a lot of work considering how customizable your character is. So far that's all the feedback I can think of!",i have a pretty beefy pc and the highest fps i can get without sacrificing game experience is  fps which is playable for sure but not the  fps im accustomed to getting in other games i play its a huge world and so much to do there seems to be a lot of room for character growth which enhances the longevity of each play through if youre the stop and smell the roses kinda gamer i also like how stressfree it is on the easy level it allows a wide variety of people and skill sets to enjoy the game or those of us who are slow to adapt to a whole new set of keys and aim style yeah its a little buggy at times but nothing that keeps you from moving forward i wish that we could see our character more often in dialogue and stuff but i know that would have been a lot of work considering how customizable your character is so far thats all the feedback i can think of,pretty beefy pc highest fps get without sacrificing game experience fps playable sure fps im accustomed getting game play huge world much seems lot room character growth enhances longevity play youre stop smell rose kinda gamer also like stressfree easy level allows wide variety people skill set enjoy game u slow adapt whole new set key aim style yeah little buggy time nothing keep moving forward wish could see character often dialogue stuff know would lot work considering customizable character far thats feedback think,Positive

"Yeah, it's a great game. I didn't bother buying it until a while after release, when the devs were able to patch the bugs we've all heard about. I know it wasn't their choice to release it in that state; that's down to the damn corpos; the publisher and the investors.Spent over 100 hours already. And I enjoyed it. So if you got the eddies to spend, and you're gonna waste the time anyway, you won't reget it.Peace out, chooms.",yeah its a great game i didnt bother buying it until a while after release when the devs were able to patch the bugs weve all heard about i know it wasnt their choice to release it in that state thats down to the damn corpos the publisher and the investorsspent over  hours already and i enjoyed it so if you got the eddies to spend and youre gonna waste the time anyway you wont reget itpeace out chooms,yeah great game didnt bother buying release devs able patch bug weve heard know wasnt choice release state thats damn corpos publisher investorsspent hour already enjoyed got eddy spend youre gon na waste time anyway wont reget itpeace chooms,Positive

"The graphical options are nearly meaningless, you need the best of the best hardware for this game or you simply cannot play at a decent framerate. Putting my settings from High to Low only increases my FPS by around 5 per increment and this is running on a 1080 TI with Ryzen CPU, 32GB 3200 Mhz Ram, M.2 Gen 3 SSD, etc, the whole shabang.
